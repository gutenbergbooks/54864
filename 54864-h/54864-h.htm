<p>We left Dr. Crack at the end of the last
volume in a fair way of falling deeply in love
with Miss Henderson, and there, for the present,
we will leave him still, conscious that no
one envies him. Our attention is now required
in another quarter. The gentle, unobtrusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Clara Rivolta, whom nature indeed had never
destined to be a heroine or even to be talked
about, continued to undergo with much forbearance
and quietness the persecuting attentions
of the fragrant Henry Augustus
Tippetson, who divided his time and attentions
between the Countess of Trimmerstone and the
grand-daughter of old John Martindale. What
points of resemblance there were between these
two ladies is not easy to say. Tippetson, however,
thought much of rank: it was so great
an honor to be intimate with a countess. Every
body said that Tippetson was too intimate with
the Countess, and another every body said that
he was going to be married to Clara Rivolta.</p>

<p>Our readers must have observed that we are
in general tolerably candid. But sometimes
we do find ourselves glowing with an indignation
not easily expressed, and feeling a contempt,
for the conveyance of which no ordinary terms
or allowed language will suffice. This contempt
and this indignation do we now feel for that
most execrable fribble, for that most attenuated
shred of a dandikin, Henry Augustus Tippetson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Singleton Sloper is a lazy, ignorant lob, and
Dr. Crack is a conceited puppy; but in neither
of these two do we discern any thing at all
equivalent in moral turpitude to that effeminate,
that more than unmanly, that almost
inhuman selfishness that disgraces, or rather
constitutes, the character of Tippetson.
This young gentleman had learned by rote
the common places of polished society, and
he played them off with a vile, cunning
dexterity on the simple Clara Rivolta, till
she was almost deceived as to his character.
Her mind had been injured, though unintentionally,
by the trumpery sentimentality of
Miss Henderson’s foolish correspondence. The
circumstances, also, of Mr. Martindale’s oddness
of character, of Signora Rivolta’s retired
habits, and of the Colonel’s general indifference
to every thing, allowed to Clara but little opportunity
of seeing or learning the world and its
moral elements.</p>

<p>Markham now but seldom paid his visits.
When he did, he was sure to find Tippetson
there before him, or soon after he entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
house; and such was the cunning and craftiness
of that young fox, that, whenever Markham was
present, he contrived to pay such attentions as
might corroborate to his eye the report of an
engagement, and yet such as Clara could not
pointedly or freezingly repel. To Markham,
therefore, it seemed almost demonstrated that
there subsisted an implicit engagement or understanding
between the two; and as Markham
saw in Tippetson nothing but the perfumed
fop, and was not aware of his dirty cunning, he
began to fancy that he had given Clara credit
for more discernment than she possessed, when
she could tolerate and be pleased with the attentions
of such an unfurnished blockhead.</p>

<p>The days passed away to Clara very heavily.
There was but little comfort to her in life, for
there was little satisfaction in her situation.
Without exactly knowing it, she missed the
intelligent conversation of Markham, which
was but imperfectly supplied by the common-place
prate of Tippetson. She did not feel
that she loved Markham, or that she hated
Tippetson; but her feeling was that of dissatisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with herself. It was not a feeling of
moral pain, but of moral uneasiness. There
was nothing in amusement that amused her,
and there was nothing in pleasure that pleased
her. Her mother was intelligent and parentally
kind; but there was in the construction
of her mother’s mind that which rendered it
unfit for a dexterous and accommodating sympathy
with hers. Her mother had all the
wisdom of a Mentor, but could not lay aside
the majesty of a Minerva. It is a painful and
disagreeable state of being, when a soul of natural
and ardent sensibility has had its feelings
wrongly excited and improperly directed, and
when, from the disappointment which naturally
results from this, it is beginning to settle down
into the coldness of apathy and indifference.
This is a condition in which multitudes have
been placed; and shame be the portion of
those who have placed them therein. “In the
transition of this bitter hour” the strength of the
mind is tried, and the destiny for life is decided.</p>

<p>Clara Rivolta was at this time in such state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of mind, that had Tippetson made an offer of
his hand, and had her parents approved it, she
would have accepted the offer. And on the
other hand, had Markham proposed to her,
and had her parents expressed the slightest opposition,
she would without any painful effort
have refused him. To her mother’s mental
discernment and strength of character was she
indebted for the prevention of the first of these
evils. Tippetson saw, as we have said above,
that Signora Rivolta knew him, and he was
therefore well aware that he could not have
any hope of obtaining Clara’s hand till he had
gained her affections, and had become essential
to her happiness. How soon that was likely
to take place is not easy to say. For greater
coxcombs than he have been loved by women
in other respects sensible and rational.</p>

<p>The mind of Tippetson, if such expression
be consistent, was of such a nature as to be
totally unable to exist without some stimulus,
and yet absolutely without power to frame
amusement or employment for itself. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
an ambition, but not a laborious ambition; it
was composed of and impelled by trick and
artifice. He could only ascend by creeping; and
he found it easier to distinguish himself by singularity
than by strength, to attract attention by
eccentricity than to gain notice by excellence.
He had been for a long while Clara’s companion.
By the sufferance of the odd old gentleman,
Mr. John Martindale, he had been in the habit
of considering and finding himself at home at
their house. He had never so far committed
himself as to give Clara an opportunity of refusing
him, nor had his behaviour to her been
such as she could at all take notice of. There
was nothing in his manner which demanded an
explanation; and had he been asked what were
his intentions, he could have replied that no
one had any right to ask such a question from
any part of his conduct. In the same manner as he
deported himself towards Clara Rivolta did he,
considering the different circumstances of the parties,
behave towards the Countess of Trimmerstone.
There was, however, this difference in the
two cases; viz. that while his attentions were indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the former, they were manifestly
agreeable to the latter. In his company Clara
was grave and silent, but Lady Trimmerstone
cheerful and loquacious. Her ladyship’s ignorance
attributed to the young gentleman a high
degree of fashionable and scientific knowledge.
Few were the Countess’s friends and intimates
among persons of real consequence in society.
Her parties were as numerously attended as
need be, and the report of them looked as well
in the Morning Post as the record of any other
congregation of the superfine. But though
many were her visitors, few were her friends.
The cards which announced calls did not bear
the names of those with whom she was personally
intimate; and if by any accident she met any of
the number, their chilling, freezing formality
kept her at a mighty distance from them; and
so far as acquaintance went, her intimacy with
them was no more than if she had been presented
at the court of the Emperor of China:
she had an audience, but not any understanding
of the party. We have, in the course of this
narrative, mentioned it as a misfortune that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Clara Rivolta had a female friend. We may
here state that it was a misfortune that the
Countess of Trimmerstone had not a female
friend; for the Dowager Lady Martindale
had taken herself quite out of the world, and
had gone to reside at a distance from town,
that she might give her undivided attention to
her family. Of her eldest son she had long
ceased to have any hopes; and of her daughter-in-law
such was her opinion, that she was happy
in any excuse to avoid her society.</p>

<p>The Earl of Trimmerstone, who had cared
but little for Miss Sampson, now cared less for
Lady Trimmerstone. His own acquaintance
with that part of polite society with which his
lady might with propriety have been made intimate,
was very small and contracted; and he
took little pains to form any friendships or intimacies
for her with them. Every body pitied
her, but nobody patronised her. Some, indeed,
have gone so far as to say, that whenever
they called, they were sure to see Mr. Tippetson
there. Some grave ladies thought of hinting
to the Countess the impropriety of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
familiarity and unreasonable intimacy with this
young gentleman. But they thought again
that it was no business of theirs; and so they
let her alone.</p>

<p>It would be an ingenious work for an ingenious
man to write an essay on every body.
Many can write well on nothing; but who can
write well on every body? Every body is a
paradox and a contradiction. Every body said
that Tippetson was always with the Countess
of Trimmerstone; and every body said that
Tippetson was always with Clara Rivolta. This
could not be true. Clara was not aware of the
young gentleman’s intimacy with the Countess;
nor had she ever heard the censorious remarks
which the calumnious and wicked world
had circulated concerning him. But the Countess
was aware of his intimacy with the family
of old John Martindale, and of the intention
with which that intimacy was kept up. Frequently
would she make allusion to it in such
style of expression, as to lead the young puppy
to imagine that she should, in the event of his
marriage, feel the loss of his company. Such indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was the impudence of this young coxcomb,
that he has actually been heard to say that he had
not quite made up his mind whether he should
take Clara to Scotland, or the Countess to Italy.</p>

<p>All this time, where, it may be asked, was the
Earl of Trimmerstone? Where, indeed! Every
where but where he ought to be. Not having
the fear of old John Martindale’s will before
his eyes; either forgetting what the old gentleman
had threatened, or flattering himself that
the language of the will would be altered, he
did not for any great length of time abstain
from the indulgence of gaming; and though he
was by no means a desperate gamester, setting
his life on the cast of a die, yet he could not
live comfortably without the stimulus; and he
did not like to be called a methodist. He still
kept horses at Newmarket, but not in his own
name. His patriotism was still so great, that for
the pure purpose of training up a breed of horses
which may make the English cavalry the glory
of the world, he continued to dawdle away his
time with stable-boys, and lose his money to
sharpers. He gamed elsewhere as well as at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Newmarket; and sometimes he was a winner.
He kept up but little intercourse with his opulent
relative; for he was not able to give a very
good account of himself. He had taken his
seat in the House of Lords, but he had not
much distinguished himself as an orator or a
voter; for he had once been so careless as to
give a proxy against ministers: he apologised
for it afterwards, and promised to be more careful
for the future. He was grievously negligent
of home, and thought that to be the most
melancholy hour of the twenty-four, in which
having nothing else to do, and no where else to
go, he was almost necessitated to return to his own
home. We have not described this noble Earl as
an ill-tempered or churlish man: he was indeed
rather good-humored than otherwise; but his
habits and pursuits had rendered him exceedingly
anti-domestic. He never spoke a word
of a harsh nature to his Countess; and even
when he had lost at play, which happened more
frequently than the reverse, he did not swear,
stamp, or rave; nor was he moody and melancholy;
but he would walk restlessly about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
house with his hands in his pockets, whistling
or humming odds and ends of old songs. When
he was a winner, his raptures were not great,
and he kept his joys to himself in silent meditation.
Thus much for vindication of his behaviour
in the married state may be said for
him, that he did not deport himself very differently
in marriage and in courtship. He
had never been a very ardent or attentive lover;
and no expectations were therefore raised by
the lover’s attentions to be frustrated by the
husband’s neglect. He suffered some disappointment
indeed in the gratifications derived
from exalted rank. He found himself of no
more consequence or importance now that he
was a noble Earl, than when he was simply and
plainly Mr. Martindale; and though this disappointment
did not sour his temper, it rendered
him still more negligent and careless. Such
was the stimulus that his mind required, that
he suffered himself not unfrequently to be led
into scenes and fooleries by which the dignity
of his character was not a little impaired. It
may be very well for lads just come from school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and abounding more in high spirits than discretion,
to transgress occasionally the limits of
strict decorum and grave propriety of demeanour;
but it does not become right honorable
hereditary legislators approaching the middle of
life to play boy’s pranks, and disturb the peace
of the neighbourhood. Such conduct does not
add greatly to human dignity; and though very
amusing for the time being, is not always productive
of any permanent satisfaction.</p>

<p>As one of these frolics to which we here
allude is somewhat connected with the development
of our history, we will relate it. One
evening, towards the latter end of May, when
the days are at such an inconvenient length
that it is hardly candle-light by dinner-time,
the Earl of Trimmerstone and Singleton Sloper
had agreed to dine at a club-house at nine in
the evening, together with a set of honorable
ones of the same slip-shod dignity as themselves.
Every thing was ordered to be prepared on the
most sumptuous possible scale; and though
the weather was not warm enough to render ice
a luxury, the apartment was ordered to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
raised to such a temperature that iced wines
might be properly enjoyed. The Earl and his
friend did not design to be at the expense of
this entertainment; but promised themselves
that a young gentleman who was to be of the
party, would, for the sake of the honor of such
high society, suffer himself to be honorably deprived
of enough, and more than enough, to
defray the cost of the banquet. The bait appeared
to take; but as neither the Earl nor his
friend Sloper was absolutely dishonest or addicted
to play unfairly, as they both trusted
rather to their own skill and experience than
to any dishonorable artifices, they were most
cruelly and miserably disappointed. For our
own part, such is our fastidiousness and delicacy,
that we think it at least dishonorable, if
not absolutely dishonest, to sit down deliberately
to play for large stakes where there is a
supposed great advantage in skill or experience;
and therefore we do not think that money is
fairly won under such circumstances, even
though only what is called fair play has been
used. We are, however, very glad, when in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
cases the knowing ones are taken in. So it happened
in the present case. Whatever the young
gentleman, whom his lordship intended to pluck,
wanted in experience, he seemed to make up by
natural quickness and observant attention; and
without any design of deep play, he was led on
“deeper and deeper still.” Now, Singleton
hinted to his lordship that it would be absolutely
necessary to apply the “vinous stimulus,”
as Dr. Crack called it, more copiously
to their too vigilant friend. But whether it
was from superior strength and vigor of constitution
in the young man, or from the anxiety
and agitation of the others, it so happened that
the Right Hon. the Earl of Trimmerstone and
his worthy friend Mr. Singleton Sloper felt
most powerfully the effects of the wine. So
much did they feel its effects, that they were
compelled to leave off play after being considerable
losers. The young gentleman, who had
not the slightest supposition that any conspiracy
had been formed against him, though he,
perhaps, might not be reluctant, with his apparent
simplicity, to form a conspiracy against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
another, felt in high spirits, pleased with
his winnings, and proud of the honor of an
acquaintance with a man of rank. At an early
hour in the morning the party separated; but
the young gentleman, as his home lay partly in
the same direction, accompanied the Earl and
his friend Mr. Sloper. By this time all three
of them were under the influence of strong
drink, and they were disposed to be exceedingly
facetious. The Earl and his friend were
on very intimate terms with the watchmen of
their own immediate neighbourhood; but, to
speak again after the manner of Dr. Crack,
“the vinous stimulus had obfuscated their
geographical apprehension,” so that they roamed
beyond their usual precincts, amusing themselves
as they went by copiously complying with
the exhortation inscribed on many doors&mdash;“knock
and ring.” This was not unobserved,
nor did it pass unrebuked by the trusty guardians
of the night. Advice and reproof are seldom
very agreeable; and they are more frequently
received with nominal than with real
thanks. In the present instance they were most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
uncourteously received, seeing that an hereditary
legislator ought certainly to know how
to conduct himself without any monitory assistance
from a watchman. The consequence of
this indisposition to take good advice, terminated
in the unpleasant and mortifying catastrophe
of sending a noble earl and two illustrious
commoners to the watch-house. But
this was not effected by the arm of one individual
watchman, nor was it accomplished till a
great conflict had taken place between the parties;
by the exertions of which conflict the
already inebriated gentlemen were reduced to a
state of nearly unconscious apathy and insensibility.</p>

<p>If this chapter were not already sufficiently
long, we should certainly be tempted to lengthen
it by a dissertation on dignity and propriety:
in which dissertation we should attempt to demonstrate
that nobility and gentry, however
ornamental to society under certain conditions,
may become, by means of weakness of head and
emptiness of mind, a most intolerable nuisance;
and we should also show that the homage which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
is paid to exalted station, undignified by exalted
conduct, is the mere sycophancy of selfishness,
altogether undesirable to those to
whom it is offered, and disgraceful to those
who offer it; and we should likewise have set
forth, for the edification of the Toms and Jerrys
of high life, the bitterness of mortification
which is felt by that amiable class when they
perceive that those whom they consider as their
inferiors actually look down upon them with
contempt. Still farther, it would be our laudable
endeavour to remind those who squander
away their means by low-minded pursuits, are
tolerably sure to remain for life in that low and
vulgar level to which they have reduced themselves;
and lastly, though not least, we should
say, with the utmost seriousness of manner, that
the low-minded, profligate, and vulgar extravagants
in high life, proud as they may be of
their loyalty and toryism, do more rapidly and
surely hasten the disorganization of society and
the downfall of its Corinthian capital, than all
the declamations of grumblers general, the
washy sophistries of puling debating societies,
or the clamorous mob of noisy radicals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>For this fine dissertation we have no room;
and we pity our readers that they cannot have
the pleasure of reading the development of the
above scheme.</p>

title of the Right Hon. the Earl of Trimmerstone.
Before his lordship and his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
made their appearance before the magistrate,
they were perfectly sober, and of course completely
mortified. They could not escape without
betraying their names, and they hoped, by
means of a private hearing, to escape a public
exhibition; but as soon as they made their
appearance, and the complaint was exhibited
against them, the magistrate uttered an exclamation
of surprise, and addressed his lordship
by name. The secret being thus published, the
Right Honorable and his two companions made
their peace with justice as soon as possible, and
retired. Now, as soon as this event was made
public, the Earl of Trimmerstone expected a
visit from his caustic and opulent relative, Mr.
John Martindale. Nor was he disappointed in
the expectation.</p>

<p>His lordship’s town mansion was magnificently
furnished: this was owing to the
taste of the Countess. Mr. Martindale, who
waited some minutes in the drawing-room
before his cousin made his appearance, was,
when his lordship entered, surveying the apartment
with a sneer of contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good morrow; I greet you well;” said the
old gentleman. “I have called to pay my
compliments, and to offer my cordial congratulations
on your very providential escape from
Bridewell, of which I think that your lordship
has been recently in very imminent danger.”</p>

<p>His lordship could not afford to quarrel with
his wealthy relative; and therefore, though
most deeply mortified by this salutation, he was
under the absolute necessity of putting up with
it, and preparing himself to expect as much
more. It is very painful for a man of rank,
who has passed some years beyond the age of
boyhood, to be snubbed, schooled, and lectured.
There is not one man in a thousand who would
put up with it. But so it was that, step by
step, this Hon. Earl of Trimmerstone had
been entangled in the snares of dependence,
and was now unable to extricate himself. He
was caught in a net which he had not strength
to break or patience to untie.</p>

<p>In a subdued and sheepish tone, he replied
to his cousin’s taunts: “I am very sorry, sir,
that I was so much off my guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! yes, no doubt, you are very sorry;
but I think if I had such a fine drawing-room
as this, I should not leave it so much as you
do, nor endanger its decorations by the dice-box.
For I suppose you have been at your
usual amusements. Oh! Philip, Philip&mdash;I
beg pardon&mdash;I mean, my lord; if your lordship
spends all your lordship’s means in gambling,
pray what do you intend to do in order to
keep up your dignity. You are too great a
man to earn a living for yourself. Your lordship
has nothing before you but beggary and
dependence.”</p>

<p>His lordship was not quite such a simpleton
as to fly out into a violent passion; nor was he
so far sunk in self-esteem as to bear this language
with unreplying patience. He replied,
with a little more firmness:</p>

<p>“I hope, sir, I have some better prospect
than this, which you are pleased to lay out for
me. There do exist many men who were giddy
in youth, and are respectable in age.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, very likely,” replied the old
gentleman. “I understand you, my lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“My remark, sir, was not designed to be of
any particular application. I only spoke generally.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! then you disclaim all reference to
me, when you speak of respectability in age.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, you put a very unfavorable
construction on my words as well as on my
actions.”</p>

<p>“Unfavorable construction! Now, pray,
my lord, as you are so very ingenious a personage,
will you be so kind as to enlighten my
ignorance so far as to tell me what you would
call a favorable construction of such an elegant
and accomplished feat as that which you performed
last night, in company with that paragon
of wit and elegance, Mr. Singleton Sloper?
Only suppose that you wished to communicate
that truly noble and gentleman-like transaction
to the world through the medium of the press,
and suppose the very kind and accommodating
reporters were to give you leave to use your
own language, how would you express yourself?
In the first place, perhaps, you would think it
an unfavorable construction to say that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were in company with Mr. Singleton Sloper.
Or, perhaps, if you could not conscientiously
suppress the fact, you would attribute the same
to your most humane and kind consideration in
taking notice of a vulgar blockhead, whom
nobody else would deign to honor with their
company and countenance. And pray, my
lord, what is the most favorable construction
your lordship would put upon the simple and
silly fact of reeling about the streets in a state
of intoxication? I suppose you would take
credit to yourself for being above the milksop
system now so fashionable; and magnanimously
reverting to the practice of the good old times,
by making a beast of yourself. And your
knocking and ringing at the doors you no
doubt designed as a gentle admonition to your
neighbours, that they should not spend so much
of their precious time in slothful sleep. There,
my lord, is that construction favorable enough?”</p>

<p>His lordship smiled, and said: “Perfectly
so, sir; perhaps rather too flattering.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled not when his
lordship smiled; but changing a sneer for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
frown, he said: “And what construction, my
lord, is favorable enough to your taste to be
put on the fact of your money, or rather your
wife’s money, lost at the gaming-table?”</p>

<p>His lordship started, and looked pale; and
the amount of his loss came over him like a
dream.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the old gentleman, “I
will totally acquit you of any intention of losing
your money; but can you acquit yourself of a
mean and contemptible design of plundering
a simple and untutored boy, by the assistance
of that contemptible fellow, Singleton Sloper?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Singleton Sloper, sir,” replied the
Earl, “is a gentleman of good family.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for his family, for they
have reason to be ashamed of him; and you,
my lord, would never have taken notice of him,
or associated with him, but for purposes of
gaming. I know the whole transaction. I
know that you had encouraged Sloper to induce
that simple boy to sit down and play with you,
and that you made yourself sure of repaying
yourself by his means for the losses which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
had yourself sustained. You cannot deny the
fact; and I think you cannot put a very favorable
construction upon it.”</p>

<p>All that the old gentleman said was perfectly
true, and the Right Hon. Earl knew it to be
so; and though he had not been ashamed to act
thus, he did feel ashamed at the mention of it.</p>

<p>It is very unpleasant to have a serious accusation
brought home so pointedly; but it is
more unpleasant still not to be able to say a
single word by way of extenuation. His lordship,
not caring to be speechless and self-convicted,
replied:</p>

<p>“There was nothing but fair play, sir, used
or intended; as is manifest from the fact of my
having been loser.”</p>

<p>“Whatever was intended, I know not; but
I cannot call it fair play to take advantage of
youth and inexperience: that, I know, you
designed to do; and I am very happy the
design was frustrated. My Lord of Trimmerstone,
you and I must come to a better understanding.
I will not suffer you to suppose that
my property is to be made answerable for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gambling-debts. I have once told you the
condition on which my will was made; and on
that condition I am well assured you are never
likely to receive a shilling of my property.
But as I have no design to leave you without
some legacy, I will tell you now that I will
make one more, and that a final alteration. A
legacy of thirty thousand pounds you will find
in my last will and testament. You know best
how much of that is already anticipated; and
as a friend, I would advise you to make the
best of what remains. It must be a miracle of
reformation that will make any change in this
disposal.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a word in answer, the
old gentleman rung for his carriage and departed,
leaving the Right Hon. the Earl of
Trimmerstone in a very disagreeable position.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Martindale had departed, the
Right Honorable began to think again most
soberly and seriously of his perplexities and embarrassments.
He made a great variety of calculations,
but none of them were definite or satisfactory.
The figures and the sums whirled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
round and round in his head, and all was confusion.
He scarcely knew, nor could he by
any means make out, whether or not he was
solvent. He knew nothing more of his own
affairs than that he was solicited for money
which he could not pay; and when by any contrivance
he could put off the time of payment,
that postponement set him at rest for the time
being.</p>

<p>There was no one with whom he could
consult. He had not a single friend in the
world on whose good counsel he could rely.
As for Sir Gilbert Sampson, he was afraid or
ashamed to mention to him a word on the subject;
and indeed there had been lately a great
coolness between them, arising from the very
negligent behaviour of his Lordship to the
Countess. And she, who should have been his
best friend and most confidential adviser, had
very little capacity or inclination for prudential
and deliberate thought.</p>

<p>When noblemen and gentlemen marry for
the sake of money, they ought always to take
especial care that they have money enough:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for it is much better to suffer many disadvantages
from pecuniary deficiency, and to remain
unmarried, than to marry one who has not
money enough to answer all purposes. Ladies
with small fortunes may not thank us for this
remark; but they will, on second thoughts,
consider that such a husband as the Right
Hon. the Earl of Trimmerstone is not worth
having. It is not unlikely that his lordship
would, had the law allowed him so to do, have
married another wife for the sake of pecuniary
aid, and have deserted the daughter of Sir
Gilbert Sampson. Perhaps it might be an
improvement in the system of accommodating
legislation, if hereditary legislators would allow
themselves the privilege of marrying two or
more wives, provided these wives were all of
plebeian extraction; by such means a greater
number of city people might purchase nobility
for their daughters, and the estates of the
titled be relieved from many of their embarrassments.
But legislation is not our present subject;
so to proceed.</p>

<p>The Earl of Trimmerstone finding that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
thinking was a disagreeable and unpleasant
occupation, and not being much allured to stay
at home by the magnificent decorations of his
drawing-room, which Mr. Martindale had so
much admired, took his departure without any
inquiries after the health or even existence of
the Countess. He sauntered about the streets,
and looked at the shop-windows, and looked at
the people as they passed, and at the carriages;
and he looked among those on foot, and among
those in carriages, for some one to speak or
move to; but his friends were not to be met
with that morning. He wondered what had
become of Sloper; for he used to be almost
always sure of meeting him in St. James’s
Street at a certain hour of the day. He
strolled into Pall Mall, and was very sleepy;
and he stood so long rubbing his eyes and
stretching his arms at the gate of St. James’s
Palace, that he positively set the sentinels
yawning. He smiled at the effect of sympathy;
and the sentinels also smiled modestly, and with
appearance of great gratification: for it is a
high honor to be smiled at by a man of rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and consequence; and they knew that he must
be a man of rank and consequence, because he
was very sleepy, and did not know what to do
with himself.</p>

<p>To keep himself awake he walked along Pall
Mall, but not very fast, lest he might have too
much time on his hands when he should arrive
at the other end. Then he threw the contents
of his snuff-box into the street, that he might
have the amusement of getting it filled again
at Pontet’s. When he had, by dint of great
exertion to walk slow, and make the most of
his expedition, arrived, after a quarter of an
hour’s sauntering, at the little snuff-shop at the
corner of the street, he felt almost fatigued
enough to enjoy the pleasure of sitting down;
and he accordingly took his seat, and was for
a time exceedingly happy, enjoying the pleasure
of kicking his heels against the frames of the
high shop-stool, and gazing at the passengers.</p>

<p>Not long had he been thus occupied, when
two persons passed the shop-door in apparently
close and earnest conversation, and seemingly
on very good terms with each other. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
them, turning a side glance towards the snuff-shop,
caught the eye of Lord Trimmerstone, and
turned away his head again in great haste, as if
to avoid being recognised. This movement
excited his lordship’s curiosity; and a few
seconds after they had passed, he cautiously
stepped to the door and looked after them.
He was certain that one of the two was
Singleton Sloper. He knew by the broad
shoulders, short neck, and shuffling gait, that
it could be no other. As to Sloper’s companion,
who was the one that had so suddenly withdrawn
from his eye in passing the shop-door,
his lordship could not form the slightest conjecture.
Curiosity induced him to follow them
at a considerable distance, and without being
discerned by them, he watched them into a
coffee-house; where, soon after they had entered,
he followed them.</p>

<p>Before he entered the room, he looked
through the glass of the inner door, and saw
that the two persons who had attracted his
attention were Mr. Singleton Sloper and the
young gentleman to whom his lordship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Mr. Sloper had lost their money the preceding
evening. This was a strange sight; and the
very good understanding between the two led
his lordship into strong and unpleasant suspicions
concerning the purity and integrity of
Mr. Singleton Sloper. He determined, however,
not to make any sudden interruption; but as he
was unseen by them, he watched their proceedings,
and saw a pocket-book produced and
opened; and he saw some of the contents of
that pocket-book handed over by the young
gentleman to Mr. Singleton Sloper.</p>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone was greatly astonished
at what he saw; and though the mere fact of
something being thus transferred to Sloper was
no proof of fraud on his part, yet the looks and
smiles of the two gentlemen were so very significant
and expressive of collusion, that could
these looks have been sworn to and properly
described to an honest and discerning jury,
there would have been in them very powerful
evidence to convict the parties of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone was in doubt how to
proceed; and after a few moments’ hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he thought it best to walk into the coffee-room
as if not having seen the gentlemen, and to
give them an opportunity to part, or at least to
lay aside their confidential looks, before he fixed
his eyes upon them.</p>

<p>The opening of the door soon excited their
attention, and they presently assumed a different
complexion towards each other; so that by the
time that his lordship thought proper to see
and recognise them, there was so great a change
of look as to corroborate his suspicion. He
knew, however, that it would not answer his
purpose to manifest the slightest symptom of
what was passing in his mind; he therefore
greeted them carelessly, and received their
careless reply. Attentively as he could, he
watched the countenance of the young gentleman,
and thought he saw in that face symptoms
of more advanced age than he had given him
credit for. He was very sure that it was not
the face of an inexperienced simpleton.</p>

<p>There was, notwithstanding all efforts to the
contrary, a feeling of embarrassment between
the parties; and much common-place talk was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
uttered at awkward little intervals, before any
allusion was made to the transaction of the
preceding evening. Sloper at length said:</p>

<p>“Trimmerstone, I have been endeavouring
to make an arrangement with our young friend
to let us have our revenge. When will it
suit you to meet us? Will to-morrow night
be convenient?”</p>

<p>Now it happened that his lordship had already
written his name on several inconvenient
pieces of paper and in connexion with certain
ugly figures, and he was not very desirous of
multiplying and enlarging these perplexities.
He would have been happy to have his revenge;
but it appeared very probable that the only
revenge which he should be likely to obtain,
would be to inflict on the person of Mr. Singleton
Sloper the castigation of a horsewhip.</p>

<p>“I cannot say this moment; but if you will
step home with me, Sloper, I will see how my
engagements stand, and give you an answer;
which you may communicate to our friend.”</p>

<p>Mr. Singleton Sloper did not much approve
of this arrangement, but was, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unwilling to exhibit any strong symptoms of
disapprobation. He only said:</p>

<p>“I will follow you in half an hour.”</p>

<p>This, however, would not answer his lordship’s
purpose, for he was very desirous of
ascertaining the nature of those papers which
Sloper had just received from the young gentleman.</p>

<p>“Oh no, come with me now, for I have an
engagement an hour hence.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, his lordship took Singleton by
the arm and led him away, saying to the young
stranger, “You shall hear by my friend Mr.
Sloper, when it will be convenient to have
another meeting.”</p>

<p>Sloper had very little suspicion that his
lordship entertained any ideas unfavorable to
his integrity. But though he had little suspicion,
he was not altogether free from such
unpleasant thoughts. As the two worthies
therefore walked together, there was much
constraint in their manners, and every effort to
get rid of it only made the matter worse. His
lordship felt more and more convinced that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was not right; but he had some difficulty in
making his decision how to act, so as to ensure
conviction if he was right, and to avoid an
awkward quarrel if he was wrong.</p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Dodsley.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Earl of Trimmerstone and his
good friend, Mr. Singleton Sloper, arrived at
the house of the former, his lordship ushered
his friend into his own apartment, and requested
him to be seated. Sloper thought that the
Earl had locked the door; but in that suspicion
he was wrong: the thought, however, staggered
and perplexed him. With as much indifference
as he could assume, his lordship said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sloper, do you know any thing of that
young man that we lost our money to last
night? I am of opinion that he is not quite
so young and inexperienced as you imagined
him to be. How came you acquainted with
him?”</p>

<p>His lordship watched Sloper’s countenance
very narrowly, while he replied:</p>

<p>“He was introduced to me by that Tippetson,
who is paying court to Mr. Martindale’s
foreign grand-daughter. I was as much deceived
in him as you were. Tippetson told me
that he was quite young, and had just stepped
into a very pretty fortune, and that he seemed
very well disposed to enter into gaiety.”</p>

<p>There was very little hesitation in the manner
in which Sloper made this reply, and no
inference could be drawn from it. But Lord
Trimmerstone saw that there was an unusual
awkwardness of manner about his friend, so
that his suspicions continued unabated though
unconfirmed. With a view therefore of probing
him, his lordship said, with more significance
of expression than he had adopted before:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you no suspicion that this very young
gentleman has a partner rather older than himself?”</p>

<p>No immediate answer was given to this inquiry;
and Lord Trimmerstone, after proposing
the question, kept his eyes firmly fixed on his
friend with a most searching and almost threatening
expression. Sloper looked pale, and was
angry, and rose from his seat with great indignation,
replying:</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insinuate, by that question,
any thing dishonorable against me, my
lord? I really do not understand your question.
What am I to know about his partners?”</p>

<p>This was quite enough to satisfy his lordship
that there was some ground for his suspicions;
and feeling therefore indignant at the
treachery of his pretended friend, he returned
with considerable warmth, almost with violence:</p>

<p>“I do mean to insinuate something dishonorable
against you; I mean to say that
you have now in your possession damning proofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of your guilt and your meanness. Clear yourself
if you can.”</p>

<p>With a contemptuous sneer, Mr. Singleton
Sloper replied: “Upon my word, I shall not
take the trouble to argue with a madman. I
must leave you, my lord, for the present; we
shall meet again shortly, and then I will give
you or you shall give me satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“You shall not leave this apartment, sir,
till I have satisfied myself of the extent of
your treachery. You have conspired with that
young thief to defraud me, and I saw you
divide the plunder; you have my note now in
your possession.”</p>

<p>Mr. Singleton Sloper had not much of a
character to lose, but what little he had he
was desirous of preserving. Seeing that Lord
Trimmerstone was resolute, and knowing that
his own case was really a bad one, he endeavoured
to soften matters down as well as he
could; and with that cowardice which continually
attends guilt, he pleaded guilty to the accusation,
and urged his own necessity as a plea.
Lord Trimmerstone should have spurned such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a caitiff from him with contempt; but Lord
Trimmerstone recollected that his own dear
character was as much implicated as that of his
friend, Mr. Singleton Sloper: they were, in fact,
in each other’s power. Then did his lordship
gradually descend from his high and towering
attitude, and feel that he himself was but one
degree more respectable than that very Sloper
against whom he was beginning to launch the
bolts of his mighty indignation, and the shafts
of his withering contempt.</p>

<p>Now there was this difference between the
Earl of Trimmerstone and Mr. Singleton
Sloper: to wit, that the first-mentioned personage
had been led rather by what he considered
fashion or fashionable practice from
one degree of foolery to another; but the latter
was habitually and constitutionally of low and
mean habits. Lord Trimmerstone was not essentially
and constitutionally of low habits, but
he had been by various circumstances drawn
into the vortex. He was a careless rather
than a weak man, and he had fallen into bad
hands. Singleton Sloper was what may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
designated a moral sloven, a man of no mind,
and of little feeling; incapable of any thing
great or good; one of the condescending among
the patricians, and never stooping but to something
that was low. These two personages were
on the whole well met. The difference certainly
was in favor of his lordship, but the
difference was not great. His lordship felt this
in their rising quarrel, and was therefore under
the necessity of bearing patiently that which
otherwise he must have resented indignantly.</p>

<p>When this explanation was entered into, if
explanation it may be called, the two friends
looked at one another like a couple of fools, or
perhaps to speak more properly, like a couple of
knaves. The Right. Hon. the Earl of Trimmerstone
was so exceedingly out of humor
with himself, that he scarcely knew how to act
or what to say. He was going to say, “Sloper,
I can never trust you again.” But upon second
thoughts he considered that Sloper was really
no worse than he had previously known him to
be. He was tempted to call Sloper a knave;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but he recollected that he himself was as great
a knave. He was tempted to think that he
would discontinue all intimacy with a man who
had thus, as he called it, defrauded him; but
he recollected that Singleton Sloper had been
serviceable to him, and might be again; and he
thought it better to depend on a rogue that he
did know, than to run the risk of relying on a
rogue that he did not know.</p>

<p>It might not be at this juncture that his
lordship’s character received the deepest stain
of degradation; but it was at this period, and by
this circumstance, that his lordship was brought
to feel how very low he had sunk in the scale of
moral worth. Then did he again and more
deeply than ever regret that the days of his independence
were passed away, and that he had
sacrificed for the sake of honors which were no
honor to him, that composure of mind and that
independence of spirit which had in early life
been his portion and blessing. He became very
low-spirited, and almost morose. His appetite
for pleasure was greatly abated. He no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
considered the turf and the betting-table the
true and supreme enjoyment of life, or the dignified
enjoyment of rank and fortune.</p>

<p>Many days passed away in a state of nervous
depression bordering on insanity; and had he in
this period laid violent hands on himself, there
would have been quite sufficient evidence to
convince a coroner’s jury that a verdict of insanity
should be brought in.</p>

<p>Coroner’s juries have a very ingenious mode
of reasoning on this subject. Thus may the argument
be stated: If a poor, pennyless, friendless
outcast of society, broken down by calamity,
and having no resource whereby to mend
his fortunes, or to better his condition, does
through an absolute weariness of life lay hands
on himself, and thus commit the sin of suicide,
he acts from an apparently sufficient motive;
and he could not have been insane, inasmuch
as it is considered that no man in his senses
could desire the continuance of such a life.
But if a person of rank or fortune who may
live sumptuously every day, or any one even in
actual and personal distress from reduced circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
but yet having friends or relatives
by whose wealth his poverty may be relieved,
and at whose table he may, if he pleases, yet
enjoy life’s luxuries, should, notwithstanding all
that he does or may possess or enjoy, destroy
himself, surely he must be insane: for who but
a madman would throw away a life which
could possibly be enjoyed? This is an invariable
and infallible rule.</p>

<p>That period of Lord Trimmerstone’s life and
experience at which we are now arrived, was
indeed to himself a season of very great interest
and emotion; but could not be so rendered to
our readers without a very long, and to some
perhaps, a very tedious analysis of human feelings;
and as our business is more with facts
than philosophies, we must pass very briefly
over this period; not endeavouring to portray
his lordship’s state of mind, but contenting
ourselves with narrating the facts to which
these feelings led.</p>

<p>Being upon reflection convinced of the meanness
and littleness of those pursuits in which
he had been engaged, and finding that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was not in his honors that enjoyment and satisfaction
which he had anticipated from them, he
seriously resolved that he would no longer expose
himself to those mortifications which had
of late gathered so thick upon him. He made
up his mind that he would give up his establishment
in town; that he would dispose of his
horses, and retire to Trimmerstone, to enjoy, if
possible, the quiet comforts of domestic life.
But when he thought of domestic life, he could
not help also thinking how ill-adapted was his
Countess for a life of that description. He had
taken but little notice of her or her proceedings,
and often, while he had been spending the night
at the hazard-table, her rooms had been lighted
up for the reception and entertainment of such
guests as she could procure. In a large party,
and in the display of finery, the Countess had
her happiness. The proposal therefore to her
of removal from town and of quiet domestic
life in the country, especially such a dull place
as Trimmerstone, came very mournfully to her
ears, and she would fain have expostulated
and demurred. But his lordship, now he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
grown wiser, had become rather sulky and obstinate;
that good-humor for which he had
formerly been remarkable was considerably
abated; and his Countess perceived the change
with a feeling of concern and uneasiness.</p>

<p>The Countess, as our readers may probably
have discovered, was a thoughtless, unreflecting,
though good-humored woman; very fond
was she of gaiety, mistaking, as many vulgar
fine folks do, gaiety for greatness, and fancying
that the most magnificent entertainments were
the chief good of life. Her ladyship’s taste
was rather more vulgar than usually happens in
that class of society from whence she had her
origin; and as the exclusives were not well
pleased with her birth, they could easily apologise
for their neglect of her on account of her
manners. In spite, however, of all the indifference
of what is called the fashionable world,
she contrived to live a life of no little gaiety.
Such companions and intimates as she honored
with her acquaintance were not the best adapted
to prepare her mind for retirement. Mr. Tippetson,
so far as reflection or intellectual digestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was concerned, had not a single idea in his
head. He had by no means any capacity either
for thinking or exciting thought in others; but
in common-place he was perfect.</p>

<p>Dr. Crack was also another intimate of the
Countess. He at least thought that he thought;
and his ambition was to unite the philosopher with
the man of fashion; which very ambition was proof
positive that he never thought to any good purpose.
He had endeavoured by various theories
to immortalise himself; but, unfortunately, he
was so conscientious, that he suffered facts to
overturn his theories, and so none of them lasted
long enough to establish his reputation. He
also was very powerful in common-place, but
nothing equal to Mr. Tippetson. His style of
talk was very magnificent, so much so that the
Countess of Trimmerstone could not always
understand his fine words and his long elaborate
sentences. This is not said by way of depreciating
the understanding of her ladyship; for
many minds of a much higher order than hers
would have found quite as great difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
comprehending the meaning of many of Dr.
Crack’s prodigiously wise speeches.</p>

<p>It may readily be imagined that a lady of
rank whose most intimate acquaintants were
such as Mr. Tippetson and Dr. Crack, could
not have much relish for a life of retirement,
wherein her enjoyments must be of her own
procuring, and must have their seat in the mind.
When, therefore, his lordship mentioned the
topic of retirement, it by no means met with
her ladyship’s approbation. She laughed at
his lordship’s gravity. That was bad policy;
for laughing at gravity only makes it worse.
By this mode of treating her lord’s humors,
the Countess made him angry and positive;
then he insisted and commanded; and then, in
the wantonness of resistance and the impotence
of opposition, her ladyship refused to obey.
That was very great folly; because she could
not help herself, and obey she must. Then his
lordship was more positive and more angry;
then her ladyship was more vexed, and burst
into a flood of tears. This last expression seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to us a very foolish one, and an absolute contradiction;
but it sounds very fine, and is generally
understood in England; and is much more
eloquent than simply saying that her ladyship
cried, or wept, or shed tears. Her ladyship
also would have gone into hysterics; but that
part of her education had been sadly neglected,
therefore she could only cry and be sulky.</p>

<p>His lordship, however, was very positive;
and in that positive humor did he depart from
his home, and direct his steps to the house of
his troublesome but indispensable relative, Mr.
Martindale. At that house Mr. Henry Augustus
Tippetson was at that moment paying
his most gracious attention to Clara; and the
poor girl was listening with all the complacency
of indifference to his silly prate concerning last
night’s opera. Mr. Tippetson had just persuaded
the young lady to indulge him so far as
to permit him to hear one of Rossini’s airs on
the piano-forte; and the first bar was hardly
finished, when the arrival of the Earl of Trimmerstone
was announced.</p>

<p>This announcement was an interruption more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
agreeable to Clara than to Mr. Tippetson, for the
young lady was not in spirits; and to a dejected
mind, sounds of joy are a sad and painful discord.
But though Mr. Tippetson was sorry to
be deprived of the pleasure of hearing the
promised performance, he speedily took his
leave of Clara, expressing a hope that he should
enjoy that pleasure another day; and he left
the room as soon as his lordship made his appearance.</p>

</div>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone had not been a very
frequent visitor at his relative’s house, and
therefore Mr. Martindale apprehended that the
present was more likely a call of business than
compliment; especially did he think so when he
observed how very grave and serious his lordship
looked. Conducting the Earl into the library,
Mr. Martindale began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“What, in the name of wonder, can be the
matter with you now? Has your lordship had
the misfortune to lose more than is quite convenient
to pay, and are you coming to ask me
to pay it for you?”</p>

<p>“You may very well upbraid me, sir, with
my sad propensity to gaming,” replied his lordship;
“but I trust this is the last time I shall
hear such reproof from you. I have seen my
folly.”</p>

<p>“Have you, indeed?” interrupted the old
gentleman; “what a wonderful discovery you
have made! Every body else has seen it for a
long while past. Now I suppose that you are
going to let the world see your wisdom. But
pray, what is the amount which you wish me to
discharge for you in the present awkward juncture
of affairs?”</p>

<p>“I have not any request of that kind to
make, sir;” replied his lordship.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” said the old gentleman, “indeed!
I am very happy to hear it. But I should be
glad to know what it is that makes you look so
serious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said his lordship,
with great formality of manner and expression…</p>

<p>“It is high time you should think,” responded
the old gentleman; “and what has
your lordship been thinking about?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” continued the Earl,
“that it will be prudent for me, at least for the
present, to give up my establishment in town,
and retire, with your permission, to Trimmerstone,
where I may be out of the way of temptation.
If you still continue in the same mind
with respect to Trimmerstone Hall, I think it
might be put into tenantable repair at a small
expense.”</p>

<p>“Very good, very good, young man;&mdash;I beg
pardon&mdash;I mean my lord.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I beg that you will not use such
taunting expressions. My title, you know, was
not of my seeking.”</p>

<p>His lordship uttered this last sentence in a
tone of such humility and submissiveness that
the old gentleman was touched, and he saw that
his relative felt a strong impression of humiliation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and therefore he felt more compassionately,
and replied in tones rather more conciliating.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, very true; it was my fault. I
am sorry for it. I don’t know which was the
greatest fool of the two; you for accepting the
title, or I for obtaining it for you. Now if
your poor father had not been smitten with the
ambition of rank, and had you continued in
your profession, you might at this time have
been in the enjoyment of a handsome and honorable
competency. But now you are a nobleman,
you can do nothing to help yourself. I
am sorry for you. But if you wish to reside
at Trimmerstone, I will put the house in repair
for you, and make any alterations or additions
you please. Your wife, too, is to be consulted
in this matter. Are you not apprehensive of
some opposition to your schemes from that
quarter?”</p>

<p>“Some objection was expressed when I made
the proposal, but of course I must overrule
every thing of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, there again you have been unfortunate.
With your views you should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
have married such a woman as that. You see
it has not answered your purpose after all, even
in a pecuniary point of view. You have made
a bad business of it altogether. I am sorry for
you; but I cannot see what is to be done for
you.”</p>

<p>It might be very true that Mr. Martindale
was sorry for his unfortunate relative, but it
was not very decorous to speak thus of a lady
before her husband’s face. This circumstance
also contributed to increase his lordship’s mortifications,
and to add to the weight of his
grief.</p>

<p>After much more conversation to the same
purpose, by which the old gentleman endeavoured
to prove his lordship’s folly, and by
which his lordship admitted it in all its extent,
the interview terminated; and the result of the
negotiation was, that orders were forthwith
issued for the repair of Trimmerstone Hall for
the reception of his lordship.</p>

<p>While the Earl of Trimmerstone was engaged
with Mr. Martindale, the Countess was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
occupied by the condoling and sympathising attentions
of Mr. Henry Augustus Tippetson.
For as soon as Mr. Tippetson was aware of the
Earl’s absence from home, he took the opportunity
of paying his respects to the Countess; and
he found her ladyship in great affliction, and
from her appearance he judged that she had
been very recently dissolved in tears. This
phrase, dissolved in tears, is one of those expressions
which, for the sake of pathos, we must
now and then use, but it is far too hyperbolical
and exaggerated for our taste; and it is our
firm and unalterable opinion, that the cause of
sympathy is not effectually served by words
that mean nothing, or that mean too much.
The Countess, however, had very clearly been
weeping, and was very obviously in ill-humor
with her lord and master.</p>

<p>When Mr. Tippetson, therefore, made his
appearance, and her ladyship, just recovered
from her tears, expressed with more than usual
cordiality how glad she was to see him, it was
impossible for so tender-hearted a creature as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Mr. Tippetson not to make some kind and condoling
remark on the appearance which she exhibited
of illness or great affliction.</p>

<p>“I am infinitely concerned to see your ladyship
in low spirits this morning.” Thus spoke
the tender Henry Augustus.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Tippetson,” responded her ladyship,
“I may well be in low spirits. This very
morning, my brute of a husband, God forgive
me for using such language,” here her ladyship’s
tears flowed afresh, “has absolutely insisted
on my leaving town; and he says that
we must both go and end our days at that vile
dull place, Trimmerstone.”</p>

<p>“Has your ladyship ever been at Trimmerstone?”
inquired the attentive and sympathising
youth.</p>

<p>“Never,” replied her ladyship; “but I am
sure it must be a dull place; there is not a soul
to speak to but a dull country squire or two,
and the parson of the parish, and he is but the
curate; for it is such a stupid place that even
the rector cannot reside there. His lordship
did not seem to want much of my company in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
town&mdash;I think he might do very well without it
in the country.”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship is very ill-used,” said Mr.
Tippetson; “I have been often astonished that
you could patiently put up with such behaviour.”</p>

<p>“But I must put up with it, Mr. Tippetson,
I have no remedy.”</p>

<p>So spake the Countess of Trimmerstone; but
her ladyship knew that she had a remedy&mdash;only
the remedy was worse than the disease. Mr.
Tippetson also knew that there was a remedy;
but Mr. Tippetson was not quite so great a
novice as to name that remedy in so many
words. He therefore made no reply, and her
ladyship was also silent; yet her heart swelled,
and the tears were in her eyes, and she seemed
altogether given up to the hopelessness of sorrow.
Now as Henry Augustus Tippetson was
an adept in common-place, he knew that there
was more prudence and policy in absolute silence
under present circumstances, than in any
language which he could utter. And as the
Countess, in the hurry and agitation of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
grief, was now in one part of the room, now in
another, now sitting, now walking, now before
the glass, and now before the window, Mr. Tippetson
was always at her side; and after many
changes of place, they at length sat down together
on a sofa; and Mr. Tippetson, scarcely
thinking what he did, actually took hold of her
ladyship’s hand, and pressed it between his two
hands more tenderly than any single man ought
to press the hand of any married woman. What
was the young gentleman’s design in this, or
whether he had any design in it at all or not,
we cannot say. But be it as it may, he approached
her ladyship in such a questionable
shape, that whether his intents were wicked or
charitable, she spoke to him, saying, “Oh,
Tippetson!”</p>

<p>Now this was too bad. Whatever were the
young gentleman’s intentions, her ladyship
ought certainly to have left him to himself, and
to have suffered him to evolve his own schemes:
it was grievously indecorous, we think, to give
the gentleman any assistance or prompting in
such matter; but we will not be very positive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
seeing that we do not understand the etiquette
of elopement. And perhaps the Countess herself
thought that Mr. Tippetson was also inexpert,
and therefore assisted him in the development
of his scheme for relieving her from
the burden of a disagreeable husband.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Countess had with so
much tenderness said, “Oh, Tippetson!” it
was impossible for Henry Augustus to avoid
saying, “Oh, Celestina!”&mdash;for thus familiarly
had he been accustomed to address the lady
while she was a spinster. As by the use of
this familiar mode of address her ladyship’s
active fancy imagined that more was meant
than met the ear, and as there was evidently
little time for deliberation, and as she thought
it absolutely indispensable to make some show
of opposition to such a wicked proposal, as she
construed “Oh, Celestina!” to mean, her ladyship
immediately withdrew her hand from
Mr. Tippetson, and exclaimed, “Oh, never!
never! never! do not be so barbarous; I
cannot&mdash;no, I cannot&mdash;I would undergo any
thing rather than take so imprudent a step.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tippetson, whose ideas of morality were
not very nice, and whose sense of propriety was
not very acute, thought that it was a gentle designation
of elopement to call it only “an imprudent
step.” He was not best pleased, therefore,
with this mode of resistance; but he was
now under the absolute necessity of kneeling to
her ladyship, and of seizing her hand again
most passionately, and pressing it to his heart,
and vowing eternal fidelity, and exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, fly with me, my dearest Celestina; I
will go with you to the end of the world.”</p>

<p>By the way, he had not the slightest intention
of going farther than Paris, or to the south
of France at the utmost. But, of course, when
a single gentleman tells a married lady that he
will go with her to the end of the world, it is
absolutely impossible for her to avoid or to
refuse leaving her husband, her friends, and
her reputation. So felt, and so acted, the
Countess of Trimmerstone; and considering the
short notice which she had, it is somewhat astonishing
that she was so soon ready to depart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
She was gone before her husband returned from
Mr. Martindale’s. Some of the servants said
that she had prepared for the excursion before
Mr. Tippetson proposed it.</p>

<p>It is a question which requires a nicer casuistry
than we are master of, to decide which
of these two precious ones was most to blame.
When a husband neglects his wife, it is the
opinion of some considerate and candid creatures,
that the lady’s conduct in leaving him, if
not justified, is palliated. But perhaps some
husbands would not neglect their wives so much
as they do, if these aforesaid wives could not
find some one else to pay attention to them.
The lady, however, in the present case, did not
leave her husband during his neglect of her, but
just at the very moment that he was beginning
to be more attentive than ever, and to claim
her sweet company all to himself. But then she
did not like to live in the country all alone, as it
were, and out of society and gaiety. Oh, no!
certainly not. Therefore she thought it much
more lively to go to Paris to reside with a perfumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
puppy in an obscure lodging, surrounded
with people of whom she knew, and could know,
and wished to know nothing.</p>

<p>Our readers would think us very methodistical
if we were to express ourself in very strong
terms against the abomination of elopements;
and those very same readers would think us
very irreligious, should we question any of
those dogmas which are supposed to form part
and parcel of the religion of the state. We are
not however about to do either the one or the
other; but we cannot help recommending all
married ladies to be very cautious how they
talk to their <em>friends</em> concerning the cruelty of
their husbands. We would also recommend
married ladies, and single ones too, not to place
unlimited confidence in romantic protestations;
and above all, would we tell married ladies
that the worst husbands are better than the
best seducers.</p>

<p>As it is not our intention to suffer Mr.
Henry Augustus Tippetson to intrude again on
our pages after his present disappearance, and
as the Countess of Trimmerstone disappears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with him, we will now so far violate chronological
order as to narrate all that remains to be
said concerning that hopeful couple.</p>

<p>Mr. Tippetson, who had desired to immortalise
himself by an elopement with a lady of
rank, now that the Countess of Trimmerstone
was in his power, did not feel quite so proud of
his conquest as he had anticipated and fancied.
There is nothing in rank where there is
no distance and reserve. The Countess, even
before they had reached Dover, began to appear
to him as a weak, silly woman. Now, if
in stealing a countess, he had stolen the title of
earl for himself, he might have been more
proud of his exploit; but as it was, he still kept
the name of Mr. Tippetson, and his poor simpleton
of a companion had no name at all. Then
again he could not enjoy the pleasure of hearing
himself talked about in the fashionable circles.
He saw very soon in the newspapers that he
gained celebrity by the elopement, but he
could not hear any remarks upon the subject.
He very soon found that his companion was no
companion; and therefore, with mighty energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and resignation, he determined to make the
best of a bad bargain. It is a great pity that
the Countess had not come to that resolution
before she left her husband. Here again we
have a lesson for married ladies; and beg
most respectfully and kindly to inform them,
that it is much more inconvenient to be neglected
by a seducer, than to be neglected by
a husband.</p>

<p>Mr. Tippetson was a man of the world; but
he did not know much of the world, especially
of the world of Paris. It is very good that
English people in the one shilling gallery
should believe that one Englishman can beat
three Frenchmen, and that they generally do
believe till they try; but one simple Englishman,
like Mr. Tippetson, may generally be
beaten by one Frenchman at games of skill or
chance in the Palais-Royal. The perfumed
seducer found out this to his cost; and thereupon
the Countess of Trimmerstone became
more inconveniently expensive to him. There
arose also another inconvenience to the young
gentleman, viz. her ladyship’s prodigious vulgarity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
He could never be seen with her in
public. The Parisian ladies used to stare at
her, though she thought herself prodigiously
fine. Mr. Tippetson accommodated himself to
the people among whom he dwelt. The Countess
began soon to grow sulky, because she had
no society. Tippetson thought his own society
quite enough for her ladyship. By degrees
that society was more and more curtailed:
sometimes he left her for a whole day; and sometimes
he was absent day and night; and sometimes
he would stay from her ladyship two or
three days successively. This was very sad,
but she had no remedy. To utter angry reproaches
she dared not; she could only plead
pathetically, and call him unkind, and use the
gentlest tones of expostulation. Her ladyship
was far more afraid of Mr. Tippetson than
ever she had been of her husband, and was
much more careful of offending him by look,
word, or deed. On the other hand, the gentleman
was sooner weary of the Countess than he
would have been of a wife; and whensoever the
gentleman, in the expression of his weariness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
took it into his head to use the language of reproach,
her ladyship, from the peculiarity of
her situation, felt unable to return or repel it.</p>

<p>Whether it be possible or not for a married
woman who has lost the affection of her husband,
ever to regain and recover that affection,
we presume not to say; but notwithstanding
the diffidence we feel in our own judgment, and
notwithstanding our own inexperience of such
matters, we will venture to give it as our firm
opinion, that when the affections of a seducer
are gone away from the silly one whom he has
beguiled, or who has beguiled him, it is the
most hopeless of all efforts to endeavour to
recall them. But however hopeless the effort
may be, it still must be made. So felt the unfortunate
and unhappy woman, who, under the
notion of liberty, had sold herself into an irretrievable
slavery. If however she possessed not
sufficient discernment and strength of mind to
keep herself from this miserable condition, it
was not very likely that she should be possessed
of wit and wisdom enough to perform one of
the most difficult of all difficult tasks, to recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a wandering affection. And the efforts which
are used for this purpose are in their nature, or
from the nature of the human mind, so exceedingly
perverse, that in the same ratio as they
fail of doing good, they are productive of evil.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that the affections of
Mr. Tippetson for the poor witless Countess of
Trimmerstone grew weaker and fainter; and in
proportion to her endeavours to retain him, she
found that she was nearer to losing him. Not
many years passed away before he absolutely
left her; and from this state of humiliation she
wrote to her broken-hearted father, praying
that he would not let her perish for want in a
strange land. That supplication was not unheeded;
she was saved from absolute want; but
she lived the remainder of her days in solitude,
obscurity, and self-reproach. We now return
to the period from whence we have digressed.</p>

<p>When Lord Trimmerstone returned from his
visit to Mr. Martindale, it was with the full
intention of firmly though gently insisting on
preparations being forthwith made for a departure
from town and a settlement in the country.
When he inquired for the Countess, the domestics
answered by looking at each other with
manifest symptoms of confusion, as if to ask
which should be the herald of evil tidings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
His lordship was naturally impatient; and such
a mode of meeting his inquiries was not likely
to make him less so. With great impetuosity,
therefore, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Why don’t you speak?
Tell me this instant where is the Countess!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he laid hold of his own valet,
who trembling in every limb replied,</p>

<p>“My lady is gone…”</p>

<p>“Gone!” exclaimed his lordship; “where,
and with whom?”</p>

<p>“With Mr. Tippetson, my lord.”</p>

<p>This answer solved all difficulties; and his
lordship immediately understood the cause of
the embarrassment manifested by his domestics.
At the information he was more enraged than
surprised, and he flew into a violent passion;
from which the rest of the servants present
were glad to escape, leaving the valet with his
lordship to answer any farther questions which
the Earl might be curious enough to ask.</p>

<p>From this man sufficient particulars were
gathered to make the whole story clear, and to
fit the matter for the natural result of an appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
before the public in the form of an
action at law; in which action Mr. Markham
held a brief for the plaintiff, and a gentleman,
whose name we could not learn, held a brief for
the defendant. As trials of this nature are in
the newspapers given at full length, and as they
are usually read with great attention by all
whom they concern, and by many whom they
do not concern, we should only be guilty of a
needless repetition were we to lay this trial
before our readers. We have noticed and alluded
to the trial simply for the sake of two
remarkable points in it: one of them is an
instance of great simplicity on the part of Markham;
and the other is a specimen of great
acuteness and penetration on the part of the
defendant’s counsel. We have here mentioned
but two counsellors; there were however six
engaged: not that they were absolutely wanted
any more than six horses are wanted for a
hearse; but it is the fashion.</p>

<p>The simplicity of Markham was manifested
in the circumstance, that notwithstanding the
fine opportunity afforded him for pouring out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a torrent of metaphors and indignation, whereby
he might have gained a six-month’s immortality
among the unfledged spoutlings of debating-societies
and wisdom-clubs, he merely endeavoured
to put the jury into full and clear possession of
the facts of the case, and to meet the plausibilities
which might be started by the counsel on
the other side. He did not say a word about
honey and turtles on the one hand, or scowling
fiends and demons on the other. He did not
talk about paradise, for he did not suppose that
there was any such place in Piccadilly. He
did not talk as if he thought that heaven and
earth must come together, because Mr. Tippetson
had run away with the Countess of Trimmerstone.
He did not seem to think it at all
a miracle that their post-chaise arrived safely
at Dover, and the steam-boat took them safely
to Calais. He did not run over all the elopements
from Helen downwards, and demonstrate
that Mr. Tippetson was worse than Paris, or
that the Countess of Trimmerstone was more
beautiful than Helen. He did not tell the jury
that all morality and domestic virtue would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
banished from the earth, or even from the west
end of the town, if they should sentence Mr.
Tippetson to pay Lord Trimmerstone a farthing
less than twenty thousand pounds. He did not
quote poetry or spout froth. So much for
Markham’s simplicity.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, let us record for the
honor of that gentleman whose name we do not
know, a specimen of his dexterity in making
the most and the best of a bad cause. It had
been proved in the course of the trial, according
to the usual practice in such cases, that the
Earl and Countess of Trimmerstone had lived
very happily together. There was perhaps
some difficulty in finding persons who had seen
them much together; but there was evidence
enough to prove the point, and there was none
to disprove it. The opposing counsel then had
nothing left but to persuade the jury that Mr.
Tippetson was so much superior to the Earl of
Trimmerstone, that the Countess was almost
pardonable for making the exchange; or that
his lordship was so indifferent to her ladyship,
that the loss was a matter of little concern to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
him. On the latter topic he dwelt with the
greatest force; and in illustrating that point,
he made use of a most powerful and convincing
argument, drawn from the fact that his lordship
did not immediately with all his household and
establishment pursue her ladyship and bring
her back again. This was a most ingenious
argument, and for the eloquence and dexterity
with which it was used, we are tempted to
make a brief extract from the learned gentleman’s
address to the jury. After having stated
that the plaintiff did not immediately pursue the
defendant and the fugitive fair one, he continued:</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen of the jury, can you for
a moment imagine that the plaintiff had any
regard whatever for his wife, when he did not
even take the trouble to pursue her and bring
her home again. Here was a virtual manifestation
of his indifference to her. If a robber
carries off that which is valuable and valued,
and the person robbed has time and power to
pursue the plunderer, does he not immediately
use his efforts to compel the thief to restore his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ill-gotten booty? Gentlemen of the jury, if
one of you should have your pockets picked,
would you not immediately cry out, ‘Stop
thief!’ Yet the plaintiff, in the present action,
suffered a robber to carry off his greatest treasure
without any endeavour on his part to
recover it. Here, gentlemen, is proof positive,
that the plaintiff cared less for his wife than
any one of you would for a snuff-box or pocket-handkerchief.”</p>

<p>At this impressive and conclusive sentence,
the learned gentleman paused, astonished at
his own wit, and waiting for the murmur of
approbation, which he thought must necessarily
follow such a combination of eloquence and
sagacity; but, unfortunately, some of the jury
did not see the point of the argument, and they
smiled at the learned gentleman’s simplicity;
but they saw that he was a young man, and
knew no better.</p>

<p>It has often been with us a matter of consideration,
how far it is advisable to defend a
bad cause; and what discretion should be
allowed in such cases to those learned gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
who have not received from nature any
very great share of discernment. We have
heard that it has been said by them of Ireland,
that bad luck is better than no luck at all; and
by parity of reasoning, peradventure it may
appear to some, both of Ireland and England,
that a bad defence is better than no defence at
all. Of this we have our doubts; for we can
suppose it very possible that a defendant,
whose cause was a bad one, should say to his
counsel, “My cause is bad enough of itself, I
beseech you not to make it worse by your wit
or eloquence.” The use of a clumsy <i lang="la">non sequitur</i>
argument has sometimes prevailed with
some juries. But juries are now growing more
enlightened; and the system of composing
juries is improved. There still, however, remains
room for farther improvement: for since
the science of crani…&mdash;we beg pardon, we
mean phrenology&mdash;has been brought to such
perfection as to prove, beyond the shadow of a
doubt, that a man who has been hanged for
murder has the organ of destructiveness strongly
developed, it is quite a reproach to the legislature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that no steps have been taken to render
that most exact of all the sciences subservient
to the purposes of society. The size of the
head is the measure of the judgment: the
upper classes, as it has lately been shown,
having larger heads, generally speaking, than
the lower and labouring classes. In order then
to form an intelligent jury, nothing farther is
necessary than that a law should be forthwith
made, enacting that no person should be eligible
on a jury who has not a head of a certain
thickness. The discovery that wisdom and
thick heads go together is certainly not modern;
it is quite as old as our big wigs for judges,
bishops, and others who, if not absolutely wise,
ought to be always thought so. Moreover, we
are humbly of opinion, that the vulgar notion
that thick-headed people are stupid, has arisen
from the ironical application of the term thick-head.
Exactly in the same manner do we now
give the name of Solomon to a simpleton; not
that we consider Solomon to have been a fool,
but quite the reverse. This theory of ours
also solves what has hitherto been a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
difficulty and perplexity to the ingenious; viz.
the apparent paradox that thick-headed and
shallow-pated should mean the same. Thick-headed,
we see, is used ironically, and shallow-pated
seriously, to express a fool. It may be
still farther observed, that our young gentlemen
do now take marvellous pains to make their
heads appear thick, by wearing a large quantity
of hair, bushed and bristled out with great
pains and study; and when entering a house,
or any place of public resort, they do ordinarily
poke their fingers through their hair to make
it stick out as widely as possible. This is a
nasty trick; but for the sake of looking very
wise, it is worth while to be a little nasty.
We make no apology for this digression, seeing
that it is very wise and valuable and entertaining;
and an apology would be dull, flat, and
unprofitable.</p>

<p>To proceed then with our narrative. The
plaintiff received an award of five thousand
pounds; and the defendant, not finding it convenient
or agreeable to pay that sum, remained
a voluntary exile from his native land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The Earl of Trimmerstone had begun to
think seriously, and almost painfully. He
looked back on the past, and was astonished to
see what opportunities of rendering himself
respectable he had suffered to pass away unimproved.
He now saw that in almost every
step he had been wrong, and he was bitterly
mortified. He knew not how to escape from
his miserable feelings, or to what object or
pursuit to direct his attention. Mr. Martindale
pitied him very sincerely; but Mr. Martindale
ought to have blamed himself that he had not
taken pains to prevent this unpleasant catastrophe.
For under pretence and colour of
supplying the young man with the means of
keeping up an appearance in the world, he
had only furnished him with an opportunity of
making a fool of himself. Mr. Martindale had
never given his young relative any of his confidence;
he had treated him with a distant and
capricious patronage. The old gentleman knew
well enough the character of Celestina Sampson;
and he also knew enough of his kinsman
to be well aware that there could not be on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
part much sincerity of attachment to her; but
he must have known that mere necessity compelled
the match. That necessity it was in his
power to remove; and it was indeed his duty,
inasmuch as his own fanciful liberality had in
the first instance created it. It was also the
duty of the old gentleman to watch a little
more attentively over the conduct of his relative,
even after his marriage, and after his
accession of title. But the truth is, that old
Mr. Martindale, like many other rich, queer,
liberal, or money-giving men, consulted rather
his own humor in his liberality than any advantage
or benefit likely to accrue from it to the
object of his bounty. It had so happened, that
at the time that his large property came into
his possession, he had no other probable or
plausible recipient of his superfluous wealth
than the Martindale family. For then he had
not discovered, nor did he think it probable
that he ever should discover, his lost and long-neglected
daughter. Now, however, that this
discovery was made, all his thoughts were
centred in her and her child; and though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
professed not to have forgotten his cousin, the
attention which he paid him was very capricious.</p>

<p>Finding then at last that the Earl of Trimmerstone
was really melancholy, and deeply dejected
at his disappointments, Mr. Martindale
began at length to feel for him, and talk to him
with friendly condolence. He quite approved
of his design of leaving London, and spending
a little time in retirement and solitude. He
offered Trimmerstone Hall, and proposed, if it
were necessary or even desirable, that it should
be totally rebuilt. He would insist on making
over to his lordship that dwelling, and the
estate connected with it, as properly belonging
to the title. He also requested that Lord
Trimmerstone would favor him with as much
of his company as possible before he left town.</p>

<p>This was not only substantially kind, but it
was also done in such a manner as to render it
pleasing as well as profitable. It somewhat
melted and moved the heart of the young
nobleman; but it did not by any means effectually
and entirely dissipate that melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
which was preying upon his spirits. He accepted
the invitation to spend much of his
time with Mr. Martindale; and when his
thoughts were removed from schemes of
gaming, and from the vulgar amusements of
the turf and the ring, his understanding being
naturally good, he much enjoyed the conversation
of Signora Rivolta and her daughter, in
both of whom he observed an agreeable and
rational manner of thinking and speaking.
Their society was to him also the more pleasant,
as it was so completely the reverse of that to
which he had been long accustomed, and with
which he connected no pleasant ideas. He
was weary of slang, artificialness, and common-place;
and he was glad to exchange them for
common sense, good taste, and sound judgment.
There might be some regrets that he had sacrificed
himself to a creature so frivolous as Celestina;
but there was no distinct wish in his
mind that he had preferred and chosen the
gentle, intelligent, and unobtrusive Clara
Rivolta. This was fortunate for him, because
it rendered his intimacy with the family so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
much more agreeable than it would otherwise
have been had he looked back with vain regret
to the past, so far as any of them were concerned.</p>

<p>Signora Rivolta, who was a woman of good
discernment, and somewhat proud of that discernment,
fancied that Lord Trimmerstone was
quite an altered man, and that the character in
which he had hitherto appeared was not his real
character, but was merely a piece of that apery,
by which clumsy ones make fools of themselves
in endeavouring to become fashionable
or distinguished. Under this impression, the
Signora paid very especial attention to his
lordship; and with a view of confirming and
establishing him in good resolutions and good
principles, very frequently directed her conversation
to the subject of religion, using however
very general language, lest the old gentleman
her father should entertain a suspicion that
there was any design of making a convert to
the faith of Rome: for Mr. Martindale had
dreadful notions of the Roman Catholic faith,
though he did not exactly know what it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
He needed not, however, have given himself
much uneasiness about the matter; for when
people of rank become religious, it is almost, if
not quite always, according to the religion of
the state.</p>

<p>What effect conversation of this nature produced
on his lordship’s mind must be narrated
hereafter. We must now pay our attention
elsewhere.</p>

</div>

<p>Horatio Markham has been but seldom
before our readers during the progress of our
narrative; but when he has been introduced, it
has been very apparent that he has been somewhat
of a favorite with us. When a young
barrister attends closely and seriously to business;
and when, in addition to his rising reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which promises at once profit and honor,
he enjoys the patronage of a nobleman of
exalted rank and commanding influence; when
the young man has a motive to industry in
seeing and partly enjoying the fruits of professional
diligence, his adventures must of
necessity be very few, and the tenor of his life
must be very monotonous. He may indeed, as
Markham very probably did, visit many respectable
families; may slip quietly into many an
evening party, and as quietly slip out again.
He may sit still, or walk about, and say little to
any body present at these parties; for his mind
may be otherwise engaged; his eyes may be
dazzled with many a beauty, and may twinkle
for an hour or two, annoyed by excess of artificial
light; and he may go home and dream
about the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments, and
the Statutes at Large, and be very glad of a quiet
cup of coffee the next morning. He may
perhaps think now and then that it would be
very desirable that he should have a house at
the west end of the town with three drawing-rooms;
and that he should have an income,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
allowing him to spend four or five hundred
pounds in an evening to entertain four or five
hundred people who would never thank him
for his trouble; and that he should have for
his wife a woman possessed of every virtue
under the sun, beautiful as Venus, but infinitely
more decent; majestic as Juno, but not quite
such a termagant; and wise as Minerva, but
not quite so prosy as Mentor. He may think,
again, that perhaps rather less may content his
ambition. He may occasionally, by way of
recreation, attend a theatre or an opera, and
he may forget next morning whether he had
been witnessing tragedy or comedy; and perhaps
he might not know at the time if he had
not a play-bill. He may sometimes have a
friend to breakfast with him at his chambers,
and he may talk very sensibly on an infinite
variety of subjects, and may give his opinions
on many a decision, and on various points of
law. He may sometimes in an evening visit a
quiet domestic family, and make himself very
agreeable to all branches of the family, talking
politics with the gentleman, economy with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
lady, poetry with the daughters, and science
with the sons: he may even carry his complaisance
so far as to discover tokens of genius
in infants six months old; and if the mania of
craniology has bitten any of the family, he may
discover the organ of numbers in a great booby
who, at ten years of age, has just got into long
division. He may hold a share in a literary
and scientific institution; and he may look wise
over a lecture on chemistry without learning
how to make soap, or acquiring the art of
detecting the admixture of cape with sherry.</p>

<p>Thus quietly may he hold on the even tenor
of his way; and gradually, though surely, may
he rise to celebrity in his profession, and to reputation
in the world. All this while, however,
he has no adventures; he is as monotonous
and remarkless as the sun when it rises
without a cloud. But if the said young man
neglect his business and run riot, and yield himself
up to any species of intemperance and folly,
then does he bring himself into ten thousand
pretty scrapes, which though not very pleasant
to himself, may by a skilful narrator be rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
highly diverting to a reader; or, if the
narrator have not confidence in his power of
amusing, he may at least assume the air of a
monitor, and give through the narrative of
transgression an admonition to transgressors.</p>

<p>Now, if the gentleman whose vanity we have
represented as being gratified by the title of
Earl of Trimmerstone had been content to form
his fortunes for himself, instead of leaning luxuriously
idle on a capricious relative, he would
have avoided many of those perplexities into
which he was thrown; and though he might not
have been honored so much by an association
with men of high rank, he would have been
honored much more by an intimacy with men
of good understanding and decorous conduct.
His history would have been more brief, and
his mortifications fewer.</p>

<p>The above remarks are designed not as an
apology for, but as an explanation of, the circumstance
that so little has been said of Markham
in this our narrative. Our readers, however,
will bear in mind, that such is the young
man’s character, that he must have been all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
while employing his time and talents as he
ought. Some little exception may be made,
and that we have mentioned: our allusion is to
the weakness by which he suffered himself to
be made almost the prey of Miss Henderson.
We have alluded, and but slightly, to the perplexity
and embarrassment wherewith he was
annoyed and distressed on this account. It
would be almost wearisome to describe at
length the torment which that silly affair inflicted
on him. He was not indeed quite such
a hero as to resolve in spite of himself to marry
the young lady merely because he saw that she
thought that he was in love with her. He had
not quite so much of the heroism of prudishness,
or the prudishness of heroism in his composition,
as to make so great a sacrifice. When,
however, that ingenious, eloquent, and learned
physician, Dr. Crack, made his appearance as a
visitor and dangler at Mr. Henderson’s; and
when Miss Henderson showed a manifest partiality
to Dr. Crack, and when Dr. Crack
showed a manifest partiality for Miss Henderson,
then a weight was removed from the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of Markham, and he recovered his spirits most
surprisingly.</p>

<p>But such is the lot of humanity, that the removal
of one calamity or sorrow is but the
making way for another. For now that Markham’s
mind was emancipated from Miss Henderson,
he began to feel more uneasiness at
Tippetson’s intimacy with Clara. It had been,
hitherto, a matter of comparative indifference to
him while he was annoyed by the persecutions
of Miss Henderson; but when trouble was removed,
the other appeared greater. He continued,
however, his intercourse with Mr.
Martindale’s family, out of respect to and at
the request of that queer old gentleman.</p>

<p>Now, Markham was modest almost to sheepishness.
He had a confidence in his judgment
as to matters of an abstract nature, but he
had not the slightest share of personal conceit
or vanity. He did not think, as some young
gentlemen seem to do, that he might have any
hand he pleased to ask for. He did not for a
moment think of setting himself up as a rival
to supplant Mr. Tippetson in the affections of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Clara; nor did it altogether comport with his
notions of propriety and dignity to sigh and
mope like a lackadaisical disappointed lover.
He conducted himself, therefore, with cheerful
good-humor; and the only symptom he showed
of uneasiness was, that he seldom stayed when
Tippetson was there.</p>

<p>Any one but himself might observe that
Markham was decidedly the favorite; but as
for a long while Clara thought that he was
engaged to Miss Henderson, she was herself
scarcely aware of the existence, still less of the
manifestation of any partiality for him. But
Tippetson could always see it, inasmuch as he
was a crafty man and full of design. And it is
not improbable that seeing this he resolved on
that scheme which he at last carried into execution.</p>

<p>Although in some respect Markham may be
called our hero, as Lord Trimmerstone is our
anti-hero, yet as Lord Trimmerstone is not all
that is bad, so neither is Markham a paragon of
all possible and impossible excellence. What a
stupid world it would be if we were all heroes!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it would be like a great school of good boys.
Now if Markham had been a true hero, he
would have married Miss Henderson without
any attempt at shuffling or delaying; and if he
had been a true hero, he would also have been
sadly grieved for Lord Trimmerstone’s loss,
and he would have lamented Mr. Tippetson’s
wickedness. But in spite of himself, he could
not but feel pleased at Tippetson’s departure
under circumstances which rendered his return
as a suitor absolutely impossible. Unobservant
and inattentive as he was, this movement
of Mr. Tippetson came upon him with the suddenness
and unpreparedness of a thunderbolt.
And when soon after hearing the news of the
elopement he received a brief from the plaintiff’s
attorney, he looked over that brief with
most prodigious attention; he saw hope in every
line of it. Never before had he perused the
long, dry, prosy details of a stupidly-drawn
brief with one half the interest with which he
perused this brief, in which the Earl of Trimmerstone
was plaintiff, and Mr. Henry Augustus
Tippetson defendant. While he was reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
it, he could not but recollect the very complimentary
epistle which he had once received
from Miss Henderson in consequence of his
dexterity and sagacity in a suit of a delicate
nature. He had no wish to receive another
epistle from the same quarter, nor would he
have been much pleased had Clara in like manner
complimented him on the present occasion.
But he knew, or thought he knew, Clara better
than to suppose that he should be thus complimented
by her. Supposing that Tippetson
was an accepted, or presumedly accepted lover
of Clara, he thought it very natural that the
present occurrence would be to her a painful
event. He wished to console her, but he
feared lest his offers of condolence might be repulsed
or ungraciously accepted.</p>

<p>Very anxiously did he await the day of trial,
and very carefully did he weigh in his own
mind the various modes of treating the subject.
Finding that the chief speaker on the other
side was a man of prodigious eloquence, he determined
that he would not have recourse to
balderdash, but that he would manage the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
business in such a plain matter-of-fact style as
that the frothy, sloppy, feathery, flowery sputtering
of the antagonist counsel should not have
an inch of foundation to rest upon. This arrangement,
as we have mentioned, answered
his purpose. And when the defendant’s counsel
had made a long, vehement spoutification, all
about nothing at all at all, the judge in summing
up observed, that though a very <em>beautiful</em>
speech had been delivered by the defendant’s
counsel, there did not seem to be any real defence
set up against the action.</p>

<p>Now, in making this remark, the judge laid
such a peculiar emphasis on the word <em>beautiful</em>,
and at the same time gave such a schoolmaster-look
to the gentleman who had spouted that
schoolboy speech, that the orator himself looked
absolutely sheepish, and he almost determined
never to be eloquent again; but, as second
thoughts are best, he retracted that determination,
for he considered that if he were not
eloquent he was nothing.</p>

<p>Wishing to be instructive as well as amusing,
we cannot overlook the present opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a digression in favor of eloquence. It is a
great pity that our barristers cannot plead in
Greek, for then Demosthenes might be very
useful to them; and it would be, in all probability,
quite as intelligible to the jury as much
of that eloquence which is now spouted in
English. To use Greek is quite out of the
question, and therefore all they can do is to
make their English as much like Greek to the
jury as they possibly can. This they often do
with wonderful success. Eloquence is in our
days most grievously neglected, being almost
solely confined to provincial newspapers, in
which we may still enjoy the fine metaphorical
language of the <em>olden</em> time. It is in those
choice repositories that we can even yet revel
in that fine figure of speech called “<i lang="la">circumbendibus</i>;”
and were it not for these and a few
eloquent barristers, and divers aggrieved parishioners
in divers little city parishes which
become immortalized by vestry squabbles, we
should have scarcely any eloquence at all. This
is such a favorite topic with us that we dare not
trust ourselves to give way to our feelings; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
will therefore content ourselves with giving a
valuable hint to eloquent barristers. We advise
them, if they wish to keep their eloquence and
their countenance too, never to look at the
judge, or at the opposing counsel, or at any
attorney, or at any one of the jury who has the
least look of understanding, but to direct their
eyes, if they must keep them open, to any one
who looks prodigiously serious and has his
mouth wide open.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that, now Mr. Tippetson
had very clearly relinquished all intention
of offering his hand to Clara, and Miss Henderson
had appointed Dr. Crack successor to
Mr. Markham, no objection or impediment lay
in the way of the last-named gentleman to prevent
a regular and formal offer of his heart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Clara Rivolta. So for a moment he thought,
and but for a moment. Most curiously do
actual events seem to amuse themselves by opposing
and contradicting human anticipations.</p>

<p>One morning when there was no business
in Westminster Hall, and when Markham, after
a late and lounging breakfast in his chamber,
was preparing to saunter to the west, and spend
his morning and, if Mr. Martindale pleased,
his day with Clara Rivolta, just as he had
drawn the brush round his hat, that daily author
of ten thousand times ten thousand palpitations,
the postman, brought him a letter, on
which he recognised the hand-writing of his
father; but the young man thought that the
writing seemed of an unsteadier hand than
usual, and he was alarmed.</p>

<p>We have hitherto said little or next to
nothing concerning Markham’s father. Our
reason for so doing is, that the elder Markham
was a linen-draper; and we were very naturally
afraid lest any of our readers should for a moment
suppose that we knew any thing about
such vulgar people. As the subject, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
must be introduced, we hope that our readers
will imagine that all the knowledge we have of
the linen-draper cast has been derived from
some cyclopedia or dictionary of universal
knowledge.</p>

<p>When Markham opened the letter, he was
still more grieved and surprised to find that its
brief and hastily-written contents announced
his father’s failure. It had been the young
man’s opinion and full persuasion, that his
father had been for a shopkeeper rather an
opulent man. In such towns as he dwelt in,
though the gentry look down with contempt
upon shopkeepers, yet there are among shopkeepers
an almost infinite variety of gradations
and degrees of dignity and rank. Mr.
Markham the elder was one of the principal
shopkeepers, and he held his head considerably
above many of the tradespeople in his own
town; and his intimacy was rather with professional
than with trading people. But, unfortunately,
in order to keep up his rank in society,
he had lived somewhat too expensively; and by
the untoward introduction of an underselling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
semi-roguish draper into the town, Mr. Markham’s
business fell off most pitiably, and he
was compelled to propose to his creditors the
horrors of a composition. We say here, and in
this instance, the horrors of a composition, inasmuch
as to such a man as Mr. Markham there
was something in it most truly distressing and
painful. We have indeed heard that there are
those who by means of such arrangements
grow wealthy, and unblushingly rise in the
world; these, we apprehend, can never become
part of the Corinthian capital of society, they
may be rather described as of the Composite
order.</p>

<p>This calamity, which had so unexpectedly
befallen the elder Markham, afflicted him most
deeply; and he communicated the information
to his son in language so desponding, and with
such broken-heartedness, that the young man
was quite overwhelmed with the information.
Breaking through every other engagement, he
hastened down to the country to condole with
his father on the calamity which had overtaken
him; and not without some faint hope that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
there might be a possibility of averting the
blow.</p>

<p>The letter simply stated that a composition
had been proposed. Markham the younger,
therefore, thought that it might perhaps be
within the compass of his power to obviate the
necessity of bringing that negotiation to a conclusion.
He made therefore as rapid and at
the same time as accurate a calculation as he
could of the means which were in his power,
and forthwith hastened to the scene of perplexity
and difficulty.</p>

<p>As he entered the abode of his infancy, he
saw, or fancied he saw, a melancholy change.
The furniture of the apartment looked as if it
had been neglected. The whole house appeared
gloomy and still; but worst of all, when his
poor father came into the room and took his
son by the hand, there was a hardness in the
pressure, but no cordiality. Markham thought
that his father’s hand felt cold, and he saw that
his dress lacked its usual neatness, while the
countenance was pale, and the voice was tremulous,
and the eye looked downwards. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
young man would fain have made the meeting
cheerful, but his sympathy with his father’s
sorrow was stronger than the father’s sympathy
with the young man’s buoyant spirits and
hopeful thoughts. Markham caught the contagion
of his father’s sorrow; and after some
vain attempts to put a cheerful aspect on the
matter, he ventured to say:</p>

<p>“But is there no remedy to be suggested?
It is not much that is in my power at this very
moment; but I do trust that I might shortly be
able to command all that may be wanted.”</p>

<p>The father averted his face to conceal the
tears which he could not suppress; and he extended
his hand towards his son. The young
man took the offered hand, pressed it, and was
for some minutes silent. With difficulty the
elder Markham replied:</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear boy, I will not hear a
word about involving you in my troubles. You
are beginning life, I am finishing my course.
It is one comfort to me that I shall not leave
you destitute: and perhaps when I am gone,
you will not neglect your poor mother. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
kind of you to come down to see us in our
troubles: my portion in them will be but short;
and when I am gone, I hope and trust you will
continue attentive to your dear mother. You
owe much to her care, and I am sure you will
not forget her. Poor thing! she will see you
presently, but her spirits are very much agitated.
She knows you are come. It is a great
blessing to us, my dear boy, that you have succeeded
so well in the world.”</p>

<p>To this and much more did Markham the
younger lend a painful and reluctant attention;
but he was too much distressed to trust his
voice to interrupt the desultory talk of his
afflicted father. It was indeed very afflictive
to him that, at the very time when he was, by
means of an honorable and diligent application
to the duties of his profession, rising in the
world both in wealth and reputation, there
should come suddenly and unexpectedly upon
him this drawback to his success; for he could
not for a moment admit the idea of enjoying his
prosperity while his father should be living
under the unpleasant consciousness that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
debts were but partially discharged. After a
little more conversation, and when the first
uneasiness of their painful meeting had been
somewhat abated, the young man very earnestly,
but respectfully, desired to be informed concerning
the particulars of his father’s embarrassments,
and the amount of the claims upon him.
This inquiry, so humiliating to a parent and
to a man of such feelings as the elder Markham,
was managed by the young barrister with so
exquisitely delicate address, that instead of
grieving and irritating, it rather soothed and
composed the father’s mind. There was also a
happy and pleasing consciousness that there had
been, on his own part, no impropriety or inaccuracy
of conduct; the misfortune was simply
and purely a misfortune, arising from events
over which he had no control. Perhaps it
would be rather too severe, and savour somewhat
of moral pedantry, should we say that
Mr. Markham the elder ought to have been
sooner aware of his changing circumstances,
and ought to have curtailed his expenses as
his means diminished; and that he ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have known very fully and very exactly all
the probabilities and possibilities of mercantile
fluctuation. But even supposing him to have
had some little suspicion and some faint consciousness
that all was not right, it would have
been a piece of magnanimity seldom witnessed
in the commercial world, had he resolutely and
boldly abridged very essentially his usual expenditure;
and perhaps that very abridgment
would have been the means of hastening the
dreaded calamity. Generally speaking, we
may say that the calamity in which the elder
Markham was involved was not from his own
imprudence.</p>

<p>To expose and regularly set forth the whole
state of his affairs was not the work of a
moment. This business, therefore, was postponed
till the following day. In the mean
time Markham’s mother made her appearance,
wearing a much more composed aspect than the
young gentleman had expected, judging from
the language which his father had used. Mrs.
Markham has little to do in our history; but
the mother of an amiable, well-conducted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
intelligent young man is almost always an
object of respect. The direction and moral
habits of the youthful mind depend much on
the practical wisdom of a mother. She does
not indeed create the mind, but she gives its
energies their first impulse. For when the
infant first wakes to consciousness, and commences
its converse with the world, the first
ray of knowledge, and the earliest of its discriminations,
beam from a mother’s eye; and
the emotions of its little heart receive their
modulation from the melody of a mother’s
voice. And is there not an undefinable, but
powerfully apprehensible difference between
the voice of inanity, selfishness, and grossness,
and the voice of intelligence, generosity, and
purity? Is there not also as great a difference
between an eye which indicates mind, and one
which is but a cold glassy inlet of uninterpreted
light? We have before professed not to philosophise,
and we restrain ourselves from farther
digression here. But when there stands beside
the path of our narrative a character so truly
respectable as that of Mrs. Markham, we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
resist the inclination to notice and eulogise
it. Much talk has been made of the dignity of
females in the higher walks of life, and many
fine and interesting specimens have been
handed up to the world of rustic purity and
simplicity; but the character of Markham’s
mother belongs not to either of these classes.
Hers was a moral, natural, essential dignity:
it was not stateliness and pomp, for in her situation
these would have been ridiculous, and of
consequence undignified. Nature often gives
to individuals in every rank of life a species of
inalienable nobility, and sometimes denies even
to some in the highest walks that nobility of
character, by which alone the artificial nobility
of civilised society can be properly upheld in its
dignity.</p>

<p>All this our readers know as well as we do;
and we have not mentioned it by way of instruction
or discovery, but simply to let them
understand the character of Markham’s mind as
having been in its earliest developments under
the guidance of a mother of this description,
and as having received no ordinary portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the same spirit. The meeting of the mother
and the son was not quite so painful as had
been the meeting of the father and the son;
for the agitation which Mr. Markham had attributed
to her had been more in his own feelings
than in hers.</p>

<p>The Markhams were what is called old-fashioned
people: not that their manners or
opinions really coincided with the manners and
opinions of any by-gone age or past generation,
but because their notions were somewhat romantic,
and their manners somewhat formal.
They had their own peculiar views of objects;
and in these they differed from their contemporaries,
and therefore they were called old-fashioned.
They would have been quite as old-fashioned
a thousand years ago: for the past is
the repository in which imagination finds its
stock of virtues. They were people of integrity
of spirit and of great moral purity, of
mild, not cold decorum. They were scrupulously
punctual and exact; and therefore when
necessity prevented punctuality in that most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
delicate of all points, the payment of accounts,
they felt it as a severe and painful affliction.</p>

<p>From what we have said of the family, their
character and circumstances, our readers may
readily imagine the feelings with which the
younger Markham quitted his mother. In the
minds of some there is a lurking suspicion that
these people were proud, and that in order to
preserve fairness and honesty in our descriptions
and representations, we should acknowledge
that much of their then suffering arose
from pride. Perhaps it might be so. Let it be
acknowledged. We can only say that it would
have been much better for the Earl and Countess
of Trimmerstone had they possessed more
of that species of pride which abounded in the
humbler family of Markham: then would his
lordship have avoided the mortification of
dependence; then would his lordship have
avoided the degradation of associating with
divers gentlemen of the fancy, and the perplexity
of losing his money to them; then would
his lordship have escaped the lectures of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
police magistrate, as touching a quarrel with
Mr. Isaac Solomons, junior, of St. Mary Axe,
and also as touching a squabble with the watchmen
in connexion with Mr. Singleton Sloper;
and then would her ladyship also have escaped
an ill-assorted marriage with one who
had no regard for her, and an elopement with
one of the dirtiest coxcombs that ever perfumed
and disgraced humanity. There is a
pride which has its uses and benefits.</p>

<p>When Markham the younger had prepared
himself for a painful and distressing meeting
with his mother, he was agreeably disappointed
to find her so very calm and composed; and it
also gave him satisfaction to hear that the state
of affairs was not quite so bad as from his
father’s letter he had been led to imagine.
A composition indeed had been offered, or
rather proposed; for as yet the poor man had
merely ascertained his inability to meet all the
claims upon him, and he had found himself in a
reduced state, but he hardly knew how much
or how little he was reduced. Mrs. Markham,
who was a woman of business and of good understanding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and who, though not gratuitously
and curiously interfering, had examined and investigated
the pecuniary difficulties, gave to her
son a more particular statement than his
father’s nervous and agitated frame of mind
would allow him to do. From this statement
it appeared that the sum required to meet the
exigencies of the case was altogether within the
compass of the young man’s power. This
thought dispersed much of the uneasiness
which he had felt at first receiving the painful
intelligence. Not entirely however was his
mind freed from perplexity; for he had doubts
and fears concerning his father’s willingness to
accept relief from such quarter. Nor was it
altogether without some disagreeable feelings
that the young man contemplated the loss of
the first-fruits of his professional success. On
the other hand, it was a high gratification to
him that it was in his power to avert a heavy
affliction from those parents to whom he owed
so much.</p>

<p>Some very profound philosophers, who are a
great deal wiser than we are or ever wish to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
are of opinion that mankind are not under very
great obligations to parents, and that parents having
a pleasure in doing the best they can for their
offspring, and feeling a satisfaction in making
all manner of sacrifices for their children, have
their reward and motive in the very acts themselves,
and therefore deserve no very particular
thanks or expressions of gratitude. For whatsoever
any one finds pleasure in doing, has not
the character of virtue, or the power of binding
or leading another to gratitude. So to illustrate
this philosophy, we may state the matter
thus. If a benefactor can truly say to the object
of his benevolence or benefaction, “I
thoroughly hate, and most cordially detest you;
and I have not any pleasure, but rather a great
deal of pain, in doing you any kind offices; and
it would give me much greater satisfaction to
see you starve, than to be conscious that you
are enjoying any of the blessings of life;”&mdash;then
the benefaction is most truly disinterested,
and the recipient is bound to be truly grateful.
Though we must acknowledge ourselves puzzled
to know where to find such disinterested goodness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
therefore, in the mean time, we will patiently
put up with such benevolence as the
world supplies us with; and we will explain
away and apologise for any feelings of gratitude
which we may entertain towards benefactors
and friends, by saying, that our gratitude
is not exercised towards them because they
deserve it, but because we like it, and it is exceedingly
pleasant to ourselves to think and
speak handsomely of those who have been the
means of doing us good.</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, only on this ground that we
can account for so sensible a man as Horatio
Markham being grateful to his parents for the
sacrifices which they had made, for the purpose
of establishing him in that possession to which
his taste and ambition were so strongly directed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I have neither wit nor words nor worth,</div>
<div class="verse">Action or utterance or the power of speech,</div>
<div class="verse">To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Shakspeare.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now during the first day of Markham’s
visit to his parents no progress had been made
in the matter of business, for as yet the answers
of the creditors had not been received. The
elder Markham had sent off by the same post
the letter to his son, and those which were
destined for his creditors. That which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
been sent to his son was first answered, as we
have stated.</p>

<p>On the morning, therefore, after the young
man’s arrival, the coming of the postman was
anxiously looked for by all three. The father,
indeed, seemed more and more dejected; and
ever and anon, instead of taking notice of his
wife and son, he muttered to himself, “They
won’t accept a composition; I am sure they
won’t; it was foolish of me to expect it.”</p>

<p>This was at the breakfast-table; and when
either his wife or son urged him to partake of
the morning meal, he coldly said, “It is not
mine, it belongs to my creditors.” That was
very true; but it was distressing to his family
to hear such language; and that not merely
because it was true, but because it indicated a
bitterness of soul in him who used it.</p>

<p>No answer was made; for neither mother
nor son had steadiness enough to trust themselves
to speak to one who was under the
influence of such distressful feelings. They
sat at the breakfast-table beyond their usual
time, and the postman brought no letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The elder Markham looked wildly and distractedly,
and he said, “Pray give me the
letters; let me know the worst. I can very
well bear it.” But when they told him that no
letters were arrived, he smiled incredulously,
and replied, “It is very kind and considerate
of you, that you will break the matter to me
gradually.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my dear,” replied Mrs. Markham,
“there are no letters this morning.”</p>

<p>“Then they have detained the letters in the
shop,” said Mr. Markham; “I will go and
fetch them.”</p>

<p>He rose for the purpose, but he presently
returned; and just as he was at the door of the
apartment, he hastily came back again, and
resuming his seat, he covered his face with his
hands, and said, in a melancholy under tone,
“Oh! I can never show my face there again.”</p>

<p>The poor man’s distress now increased to a
degree that rendered it almost as painful to
witness as to bear. It is indeed hardly to be
imagined to what excess it might have proceeded,
had it not been for an interruption of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
peculiar and unexpected nature. This was the
appearance of the principal creditor, whose
high opinion of Mr. Markham’s integrity would
not permit him to satisfy himself with a mere
letter of reply to the communication which he
had received from the embarrassed tradesman.</p>

<p>There was ushered into the apartment where
the family was sitting a very tall thin man, in
a long single-breasted drab coat of the finest
cloth that was ever woven, and wearing a hat
which in its shape and expression so sympathised
with the wearer’s look, that the hat and the
head seemed made for each other. The visitor
stalked directly and undeviatingly up to the
elder Markham, took hold of the poor man’s
hand, squeezed it very hard, and shook it very
violently; and after performing this ceremony
in total silence, and with most unperturbable
steadiness of look, he then spoke with a shrill
nasal twang, at the very top of his voice;
“Neighbour Markham, I am sorry to see thee.”</p>

<p>This unusually loud noise and strange-sounding
voice was quite a relief to the party,
who had that morning held intercourse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
each other only in low murmurings and subdued
and sorrowful tones. To such a greeting,
on such an occasion, Mr. Markham felt it difficult
to reply. He only shook his head, and
said, “I am sorry to see you, sir.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the man in drab, who had taken
a seat by the side of poor Mr. Markham, and
had crossed his extended legs and clasped his
long fingers, leaving only his thumbs at liberty
to move, screwed up his lips as tight as a
miser’s purse, and, as if economical of words,
uttered through the nose a sound which no
vowels or consonants in any European alphabet
are competent to express, either severally or
conjointly. As it oftentimes occurs that words
are used when no meaning is conveyed, so does
it on the other hand sometimes happen that
much meaning is conveyed when no words are
uttered. Thus it was on the occasion to which
we now allude. Mr. Markham was familiar
with the above-named unwriteable sound; and
he knew that it indicated in the mind of him,
through whose nose it passed, a feeling of compassion
and a promise of kindness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to Mrs. Markham, the visitor said,
“Mary Markham, this is thy son, probably.”
On this, Horatio Markham took occasion to
speak to the creditor, and began by saying,</p>

<p>“I am very much concerned, sir, for the
unpleasant situation in which my father is now
placed; but I believe we shall be able to surmount
the difficulty, if not immediately, at least
in a very short time.”</p>

<p>“Do thee, indeed?” said the Quaker; and
without making more reply, or vouchsafing to
the young gentleman any farther attention, he
directed himself again to the elder Markham,
and said to him, “Thy son is a promising
young man.”</p>

<p>“I have reason, Mr. Wiggins, to be very
well pleased with my son; he is indeed a blessing
to us.”</p>

<p>“Neighbour Markham, my name is Wiggins;
but my name is not Mister. But let us proceed
to business; for to that intent I came hither.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the creditor thrust his long arm
into a deep side-pocket, and extracted therefrom
a long black letter-case, and from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
letter-case he drew out the letter which he had
received from Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>“Neighbour,” said the Quaker, “thee might
be disposed to think that I had forgotten thee,
seeing that thy letter did not receive an immediate
answer: but I was willing to see thy
other creditors to know how they stood inclined
towards thee. So yesterday we had a meeting.”</p>

<p>“A meeting of my creditors!” exclaimed
Mr. Markham, with great emphasis of grief;
“Oh God! that I should ever come to this!”</p>

<p>“Thee will come to something worse, neighbour
Markham, if thee don’t leave off taking
the name of the Lord in vain,” replied Mr.
Wiggins; “but thee is impatient; thee will
not listen. I tell thee that there has been a
meeting of thy creditors, and they are sorry
for thy misfortunes, and they are disposed to
assist thee. They respect thy integrity; but
they would not have thee take the name of the
Lord in vain. It is a sad thing, neighbour, to
want money; but it is worse to want patience:
thee will never get rich by putting thyself in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
passion. But thy creditors will not trouble
thee at present. They besought me to tell thee
that they would wait thy own time.”</p>

<p>At this information Mr. Markham shook his
head mournfully. There are those who when
in trouble are exceeding sceptical as to good
tidings, and are slow to believe what pretends
to promise them good. Poor Mr. Markham
was of that description. He hardly liked to
have the pathos of his deep sorrow interrupted
or interfered with. But his son Horatio was a
man of more words and somewhat less formality.
He readily expressed his thanks to the principal
creditor, but at the same time added,</p>

<p>“I trust, sir, there will be no necessity for any
long forbearance; had my father stated all the
particulars to me before he wrote to his creditors,
I believe there would not have been found
any occasion for the step which he has now
taken. I will be answerable&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Wiggins interrupted the young
barrister. “Young man, be not in too great
haste to part with thy money; thee has not been
in possession of it long enough to know its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
weight.” Then turning to the elder Markham,
he said, “Neighbour Markham, thee shall go
on with thy business, and if thee needs any supply,
thy credit is good with me yet. Let thy
son keep that which he has earned. Farewell.”</p>

<p>Not a word that could be said, nor any entreaties
whatever were effectual to detain the
strange Mr. Wiggins a moment after he had said
farewell. It seemed to him a matter of conscience
to depart as soon as he had uttered the
word which indicated the intention of going.</p>

<p>The spirits of the elder Markham were not
cheered by that visit which was designed to remove
an oppressive weight of sorrow from his
mind. The very consideration that there had
been any thing like a necessity for proposing a
composition weighed very deeply upon him,
and produced serious illness.</p>

<p>Markham, whose intention it had been to
make a short visit to his native place, now
found himself powerfully and indeed irresistibly
detained. It was not indeed absolutely necessary
for him to be in town at this time; and
had even his professional occupations urged his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
attendance, it is more than probable that their
importunity would have been disregarded: for
it is not likely that his father’s commercial
perplexities should have commanded his sympathies
more strongly than an actual sickness.</p>

<p>Our English proverbs are not frequently to
our taste; for many of them want point, not
a few are destitute of truth, and most of
those which are correct are cold common-place
truisms. There is, however, one which
occurs at the present juncture, not indeed
very graceful in its expression or profound in
its observation, but having in its meaning and
application a moral lesson which cannot be too
frequently or too earnestly inculcated on the
misery-loving and ever-grumbling people of
this most highly-favored land. The proverb to
which our allusion points is as follows, “It is
an ill wind that blows nobody good.” Certainly
it was not pleasant to the father of Horatio
Markham to be so situated that he must be
within a little of bankruptcy. Certainly it was
not pleasant to the young man to find that his
professional success should in its earliest stages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
be destined to repair the ravages which untoward
circumstances had made in his father’s
property. Certainly it was very painful to see
that after this calamity had been partially
healed, or at least palliated, his poor father had
so taken to heart the unexpected affliction, as
to suffer from its influences a severe bodily illness.
Certainly it was mortifying to the young
man who was looking upwards in society, and
was in the way of what is called making his fortune,
to have this sudden and unforeseen blight
coming over his fair hopes. Certainly also there
was something sorrowful to his soul in the consideration
that at the very moment in which
there seemed a probability that his attachment to
Clara might be honorably avowed, he should
be called away from scenes of hope and brightness
and opulence, to a house of fear, of gloom,
of poverty.</p>

<p>These circumstances gathering together
round the mind of our young friend perplexed
and pained him. It is very true that he was
perfectly well acquainted with all the commonplaces
of consolation, and he knew that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
not unfrequently arises good out of evil. But
what does knowledge amount to in the way of
consolation? He saw no particular good end
likely to be answered by all these perplexities;
but he saw, or thought he saw, a great evil as the
probable result of them. He had left London
without giving notice to any of his friends; and
the business on which he visited the country was
not one which he was very desirous of advertising.
He therefore very naturally thought
that Clara would suppose that he was not very
anxious to renew the acquaintance with her;
and he also contemplated the possibility of some
more rational being than Tippetson making advances
more acceptably and successfully. This
thought was a source of uneasiness to him, and
he could not see any mode of communicating to
Mr. Martindale the cause of his sudden absence
from town. He had thought that a day or two
would suffice, and that in that short time he
should not be missed; but now he found that
he was likely to be detained much longer; and
should he on his return to London state that his
father’s illness had delayed him in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
beyond his intention, there would still be something
remarkable in the fact of his hasty and
silent departure from town.</p>

<p>He therefore thought that this illness was
most peculiarly unfortunate and calamitous, as
not only being distressing to his parents, but
probably productive of serious inconvenience to
himself.</p>

<p>We have already intimated that Horatio
Markham was deficient in some of those qualities
that form a hero. Here we have occasion
to repeat the observation. His want of
heroism was manifested in several points alluded
to in the present chapter. For had he
been a proper hero, he would never have suffered
Mr. Wiggins to grant any thing of indulgence
to the embarrassed shopkeeper, but
he would forthwith have paid to the utmost
every farthing of the debt to him and the other
creditors, had he been under the necessity for
that purpose of parting with his library and
every saleable article in his possession, even to
his very watch. Had he been a proper hero,
he would have regarded with more apathy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
magnanimity a commercial failure. Had he
been a proper hero, he would not have admitted
the possibility that there could exist on the
face of the earth any human being but himself
worthy of Clara’s hand, or likely to obtain it.
Had he been a proper hero, he would not have
been quite so shy, as he clearly was, of the fact
that his father kept a linen-draper’s shop in a
country town.</p>

<p>We have represented Horatio Markham as a
man of talent and general good judgment, but
we have not described him as a paragon of all
possible and impossible excellence. He was a
steady, quiet, sober, clear-headed man, who understood
his professional and his moral duties,
who gave himself seriously to the business to
which he was brought up, and who wished very
naturally to rise in the world. In a very high
degree he was early successful; but he was not
vain of that success, nor did he think himself
the greatest or the only genius in the world.
In matters of intellect he was unpretending,
and in matters of a moral nature pure and conscientious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>As he had proceeded he became more ambitious;
and by the distinguished patronage which
he enjoyed, he hoped to take ultimately a higher
rank in society than at the commencement of
his career he had anticipated. He had hoped
that his parents, either by his own exertions or
by their circumstances, might soon retire from
business; but when instead of this retirement
he found that there was pecuniary embarrassment
which he could not easily, if at all, remove,
he was severely disappointed; and when in addition
to this the illness of his father detained
him from town and from Clara, he feared the
worst that could happen. Nor could he imagine
that in this complication of unfortunate and
perplexing circumstances there was any good
likely to arise either to himself or to any one
else. But he was wrong; for the illness of the
father was the means of deciding the destiny of
the son’s life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“To deal in wordy compliment</div>
<div class="verse">Is much against the plainness of my nature.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Rowe.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Considering the language with which the
preceding chapter is closed, it would not be
decorous to fly off in a tangent to discuss the
movements of other characters in our narrative;
though we may very well suppose that some of
our readers would be glad to know how the
Right Hon. the Earl of Trimmerstone bears his
retirement, and how he looks in his reformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
condition. Nothing more, however, does it
suit us now to state on this head, than that
orders had been given, and were rapidly proceeding
in their execution, for the repair and
reformation of Trimmerstone Hall, and that his
lordship found some amusement in superintending
these repairs.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, Mr. Martindale,
who was aware that it would be doing more
harm than good to supply his noble relative’s
extravagance with unlimited means of indulgence,
thought that he should do his lordship
more essential service by procuring him some
appointment, which might have at least the
semblance of occupation for him. With this
view he waited upon the nobleman whom we
have before mentioned as having patronised
Horatio Markham. Here we are strongly
tempted to observe how inaccurate is our ordinary
language. We call men high in office,
men in power. This is wrong. They find that
the higher they rise, the more circumscribed is
their power. The greater is their patronage,
the less able are they to do as they will. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
country parson has power to appoint his own
curate; a country squire may choose whom he
will for butler, coachman, or footman; but they
who have the distribution of better things than
curacies and coach-boxes, have to consult and
to be guided by many more wills, minds, and
opinions than their own.</p>

<p>Mr. Martindale found this to be the case
with the nobleman to whom he made application
in the present instance. Nothing could be
more cordial or polite than the reception which
Mr. Martindale experienced, and nothing could
be more gratifying than the kind attention
wherewith his lordship made inquiry after the
health of the various members of his family.
But when the business was mentioned for which
the call was made, nothing could exceed the
regret which his lordship felt and expressed
that at present he had it not in his power to
accommodate so respectable and valued a friend
as Mr. Martindale. There was certainly sincerity
in these expressions, though probably
they were used with little variation of phraseology
to many others. It would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
much more agreeable to his lordship had it
been in his power to grant many more requests,
and to oblige many more friends; but, as he
himself said to Mr. Martindale, he actually had
for every place at his disposal at least fifty applications,
and many of them accompanied with
recommendations and arguments of a most
pressing nature.</p>

<p>As Mr. Martindale was a reasonable man,
and one to whom his lordship could speak
freely, there soon sprung up between them
some conversation on the topic of patronage.</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mr. Martindale,” said his
lordship, “it is by no means correct to say that
I <em>enjoy</em> the distribution of patronage. It is an
affair of constant perplexity; and I sometimes
am tempted to wish that some of the public
grumblers were placed for a while in my situation.
They would then see that it is not the
easiest matter in the world to please every
body.”</p>

<p>“I dare say not, I dare say not, my lord,”
replied Mr. Martindale; “we cannot administer
our own affairs to please every body, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
not easier to give satisfaction by the administration
of public affairs. I will not fly out into
discontent and opposition, because I cannot have
every thing I wish for my scape-grace kinsman.”</p>

<p>The distributer of patronage smiled, and replied,
“It is not every one that is so considerate,
Mr. Martindale. There was a situation vacant
some time ago, and I disposed of it to a young
man of no family or connexion, and with whom
I was made acquainted by mere accident, and
whom I took up purely on the ground of his
good sense and honorable application to business,
and I find that I was abundantly right in
the judgment which I formed. But I was
afterwards exposed to so much expostulation
and reproof from quarters where you might
least expect it, that I am almost afraid of following
my own judgment in the most trifling
matters that relate to the public service.”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Mr. Martindale, “the
person to whom your lordship alludes: he is
certainly a man of most excellent mental and
moral qualities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“And for a man of real ability,” added his
lordship, “the most unpretending and unassuming
I ever knew. He carries his reserve
to an excess; for I never see him here among
my visitors.”</p>

<p>Now, as Mr. Martindale was an impetuous
and hasty man, and was withal mightily partial
to this said Horatio Markham, he forgot for a
time his noble kinsman, and after taking leave
of his lordship, he went immediately to Markham’s
chambers to give him a hint that it might
be advisable to pay a little more attention to
his patron. It also occurred to the old gentleman
that he himself had not seen Markham for
several days; so he designed to give him also
an intimation concerning that neglect.</p>

<p>Greatly to the surprise of the old gentleman,
Markham was not in town; and more than that,
his clerk could not say for a certainty when he
would be in town. Upon receiving this information,
Mr. Martindale took the liberty of
inquiring very particularly and curiously to
find out where he was, and what was the occasion
of his absence. Now, when a rich old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
man asks questions, a poor young man is ready
enough to answer them according to the best of
his ability, unless he have some especial reason
for concealment. There being with Markham’s
clerk no such reason, he endeavoured to
give Mr. Martindale the benefit of all his knowledge
together with the result of his conjectures.
From all that could be gathered from
this informant, it appeared that Markham was
with his parents, and that his father was unwell.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Martindale did not blame the young
man for visiting a sick parent, but he thought
it very strange that he should make a secret of
his departure from town. It was therefore the
old gentleman’s first intention to send a note to
his young friend reminding him of the neglect
with which he had unintentionally treated
his kind and considerate patron; but as the
town where Markham’s father resided was not
much out of the line of road leading to Trimmerstone,
and as the old gentleman was especially
fond of a personal intermeddlement with
brick and mortar, he conceived the design of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
paying a visit to Trimmerstone Hall, and calling
upon Markham in his way there.</p>

<p>The old gentleman found his way into the
little parlour at the back of the shop in the
same manner as when he first introduced himself,
as stated in the commencement of our
narrative. His appearance, on the present
occasion, did not excite less surprise, than when
he first made himself known to them. When
he entered the apartment, the elder Markham
was sitting by the fire-side in an easy chair, and
had the appearance of one slowly recovering
from a long illness. His countenance was much
changed, and he looked considerably older than
when Mr. Martindale first saw him. The old
gentleman was a very observant, quick-sighted
man, and had a perfect recollection of Mr.
Markham’s appearance when he had seen him in
health. He was sorry to see him so much altered,
and he expressed his concern accordingly.
Mr. Markham attempted to rise. Mr. Martindale
quickly caught hold of his hand, and
almost too roughly for an invalid forced him
back into his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sit down, my good friend, sit down. I
hate ceremony. Sorry to see you so ill. Your
son never let me know any thing of your indisposition.”
Then addressing himself to Horatio
Markham, he went on, “So, Mr. Barrister,
you left town in so great a hurry, you could not
condescend to give me notice of your departure.”</p>

<p>The younger Markham was about to speak,
but Mr. Martindale waited not for a reply. He
proceeded to make more minute inquiries concerning
the illness of Mr. Markham the elder;
but was not patient enough to wait for distinct
and separate answers. When a person in high
spirits and of natural hastiness of manner enters
into any thing of a conversation with others
who are not in high spirits, he does not immediately
notice the contrast, for the loud crowing
of his own voice is for a time a reflection
of his own cheerful thoughts; but even vivacity
needs sympathy to support it, and cannot
long exist without. And when the first rush of
hasty greeting is over, then it is seen and felt
that the vivacity is not mutual, and then the
cheerfulness abates. So fared it with Mr. Martindale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
who was for his years a man of astonishing
vivacity and activity. He soon perceived
that there was a depression of spirits in
the family, and he rebuked himself for the almost
levity of manner with which he had addressed
them. He then went on to talk common-place,
and took an opportunity of hinting
to Horatio that it would be proper for him to
pay a little more homage to his patron. The
mention of this brought some observations from
Mrs. Markham, acknowledging Mr. Martindale’s
kindness in taking notice of her son.</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied the old gentleman, “I think
it an honor to have your son’s acquaintance;
and I wish he would not be quite so diffident of
himself. He is in the way to preferment; but
he must not forget that though such men as his
noble patron may be ready enough to reward
merit, they have no time to hunt about for it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham had, as we have observed, a degree
of pride, and being the mother of a son who
was a young man of rather superior understanding,
she supposed that he was far above all the
rest of the world, and must make his way by dint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of his own natural talents: therefore, as if she
imagined that her son required and needed no
other patronage than the power of his own
mind, she replied,</p>

<p>“I feel very highly gratified, sir, by the
kindness which my son has experienced from
you, but I wish that his success in the world
may be rather owing to his own merit than to
patronage.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied Mr. Martindale, “your
notions are very good for the country; but London
is a very large place, and those who have
talents must advertise them by some means or
other. I am an old man, I have seen something
of the world, and I can tell you what I
have seen; I have seen talents lost, ruined, buried
alive, rendered useless, ay, worse than useless,
a very torment to their possessors, because they
have had a pragmatical conceit that they must
be independent of patronage. Excuse me, my
good lady, I am an oddity I know. Now let
me ask you one question. If you wished to go
to the top of St. Paul’s Cathedral, which way
would you go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Markham smiled at the oddness of the
illustration, and replied, “Of course, sir, I
should go the usual way up the stairs.”</p>

<p>“To be sure you would,” replied Mr. Martindale;
“but if, under the notion of independence,
you should attempt to climb up
without the usual assistance of common-place
steps, you would find yourself miserably disappointed.
I tell you what, Mrs. Markham, I
hate sycophancy and fawning as much as you
can do; and I should be no real friend to your
son, did I recommend him to adopt such means
of advancing himself in the world. But there
is a fault on the other side; there is an affectation
of independence. Now this affectation
neither the mob nor the aristocracy can endure.
As for your son, he can only rise by means of
his talents; he has nothing else to go to market
with; he has no votes or borough-interest
wherewith to bribe ministers, and no pompous
foolery of speechification wherewith to purchase
the approbation of the mob. I respect
him for his plain straightforward good sense, and
if my cub of a cousin, who has made his nobility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
ridiculous by his slip-shod dignity and
equivocal respectability, had possessed those
qualities which your son possesses, he might
be called Right Honorable with a serious
countenance.”</p>

<p>This was the first time that Mr. Martindale
had given way to such serious reprobation
of his noble relative. Our readers will, for
Markham’s sake, be glad to hear that the young
gentleman had left the room before this speech
was uttered. There was so much seriousness
in the language and manner of expression, that
though Mrs. Markham would to a person of
her own rank in life have ventured to make
some reply of alleviation, but to a person so
much her superior as Mr. Martindale she was
silent. The talk then took another direction;
but Mr. Markham the elder did not join in
the conversation, except so far as to express
his acknowledgment to Mr. Martindale for
the kindness which he had shown to the young
man.</p>

<p>The singular old gentleman then took his
leave, almost as abruptly as he had entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
house. It is, perhaps, one of the most difficult
lessons which persons in a certain rank have
to learn, to know how to manage condescension
well. When a person of this rank converses
with an inferior with a temporary assumption
of equality, there generally exists in the mind of
the inferior a feeling of awkward restraint, and a
consciousness that this aspect or tone of equality
is merely put on, and rises not from any feeling
on the part of the individual so condescending
of the natural equality of the species: and
in the apparent equality, greatness is always
jealous of encroachments. It was, however,
a favorite amusement with Mr. Martindale,
under pretence of not regarding the artificial
distinctions of society, to hold free and unrestrained
intercourse with persons of every rank
and of no rank; but he could never divest himself
of the tone and air of dogmatism. He always
spoke as if he thought himself Sir Oracle:
yet nevertheless he was very good-humored
withal, and had, amidst all his oddities, a great
benevolence of feeling and disposition.</p>

<p>As we have noticed the inaptitude with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
which greatness sometimes condescends, it may
not be improper, on the other hand, to observe
that in those of inferior rank there is not unfrequently
on such occasions either a mean servility
or a jealous suspicion, that the great one
so condescending thinks more of his superiority
than he really does.</p>

<p>These mutual inaptitudes are great means of
preserving, even in a civilised country, the
strong distinction of caste. But in the interview
which Mr. Martindale had with the
parents of Horatio Markham there was very
little of this awkwardness, and the old gentleman
afterwards observed that Mrs. Markham
was one of the most sensible women he had
ever seen.</p>

<div class="verse">And steel your heart to such a world of charms!”</div>
<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Addison.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Markham was glad that Mr. Martindale’s
visit had terminated without discovering the
unpleasant circumstances in which the young
man’s father had been involved: and as soon
as the elder Markham was sufficiently recovered
to attend to his usual occupation, the
young man took his leave of his parents and
returned to town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Now another season was commencing in the
great metropolis, and the family of Colonel
Rivolta had become tolerably well naturalised.
The Colonel himself, from his relation to so
opulent a man as old John Martindale, became
a person of some consequence, and he had the
honor to lounge and yawn about the streets
with divers persons who bore titles or were in
expectation of titles. Much as ignorant and
superficial people may laugh at the old story
of Jack helping Dick to do nothing, we are
firmly and seriously of opinion that a man is
never so much in need of assistance as when
he has nothing to do. Colonel Rivolta found
many persons in London in this predicament,
and such was the natural benevolence of his
mind that he took an inexpressible delight in
affording them all the assistance in his power.
The Colonel was never without a cigar in his
mouth; and therefore he was peculiarly acceptable
to those young noblemen and gentlemen
who could not for the weakness of their
heads smoke in the morning, because though
they could not smoke they could employ themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with sniffing the fumes of the Colonel’s
cigars.</p>

<p>The Colonel was not indeed very intimate
with the English language so as to enjoy and
understand its delicacies and niceties; but he
was sufficiently well acquainted with the language
and air and style of fashionable impertinence
and coxcomical exclusiveness, and he
could laugh remarkably well. He was also exceedingly
well-dressed, and had that exquisitely
ridiculous military air, which if it be not the
glory is at least the pride of most of those
green ones who have entered the army since
1815. The Colonel had also in very great perfection
the imitative faculty, which enabled him
to catch to the very life the manners of the
people with whom he associated. He caught
with great facility all the fashionable fool’s
tricks of the dinner-table; and notwithstanding
his imperfect knowledge of the English language,
he had no difficulty in understanding
and in making himself understood in all matters
touching eating and drinking: on these subjects
he was eloquent and animated. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Colonel was not a very young man, as may be
inferred from the age of his daughter, but he
had the air and manners of youth; and he was
thus more ridiculous, if possible, than those
young men with whom he chiefly associated.
This, however, could be said for him which
could not be said for them; namely, that he had
seen actual and severe service, and had undergone
many hardships: there was therefore
something of philosophy in his very flippancy of
character and manner.</p>

<p>Of a gentleman of this description while
sauntering about in time of peace, it is very
clear that the historian’s pen can have little or
nothing to record: nor can our readers be
much surprised if, when speaking of the interests
of Clara Rivolta, we should say little or nothing
of her father as influencing her destiny or directing
her actions. It is not indeed to be supposed
that such a woman as Signora Rivolta
should pay very great deference to the opinions
of Colonel Rivolta, even if he had any opinions,
which, by the way, he had not. If any of our
readers are astonished at the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
daughter of John Martindale should, in spite of
all her good natural understanding, have condescended
to marry such a man as Colonel Rivolta,
we can only say that such readers must have a
very limited circle of acquaintance, or be gifted
with the not unusual faculty of being blind to
one half of that which passes immediately before
their eyes. We have hinted before at this
apparent incongruity, and our reference to it
again in this place to account for the omission
of Colonel Rivolta’s name or observations in
some part of our narrative, which is now about
to be opened; and we wish also to avoid any
thing which might appear disrespectful to the
nobler sex: for it would be very wrong to
represent the disposal of a daughter’s hand as
being more at the will or under the influence of
the mother than of the father, unless some
special and peculiar reason were given for the
fact. Man is the lord of the creation, and he
has right because he has power. If any body
can find a better reason let them, we will not
quarrel with them or dispute the point; our business
is not philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>To our narrative then. Horatio Markham
no sooner arrived in town than he went to pay
his respects to his noble patron. He was graciously
received. He made a few common-place
apologies, which were received with due
common-place politeness, and that business was
soon over.</p>

<p>From the house of his noble patron he made
the best of his way to the residence of his
queer old friend, John Martindale. Almost
all single men, who are not downright hermits,
have some peculiar pet place of call; some
friend’s house, where they uniformly make
their first and last visit; where they pop in
without fear of intruding. Sometimes, such is
the fickleness of humanity, these places are
changed; and even Markham, with all his
steadiness, was once in great danger of substituting
the house of Mr. Henderson for that of
Mr. Martindale. A thousand blessings on the
head of Dr. Crack for supplanting him there!</p>

<p>Mr. Martindale was not at home when
Markham called. That, of course, Markham
knew; but he would not suffer any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
reproaches from the old gentleman for neglect
of attention. Signora Rivolta and her daughter
were sitting together; the mother was reading,
the daughter was drawing. The mother laid
aside her book when Markham entered the
room; and she smilingly said, that her time
might be better employed than in reading for
amusement. The book was a volume of Italian
plays. An Englishwoman would have thought
herself most learnedly occupied with the same;
especially if she had had by her side a dictionary,
which she was frequently under the necessity
of consulting. There is no waste of time
in reading books of amusement when they are
not amusing. What a fuss people make about
amusement, and very sensible people too! But
perhaps there is a pleasure in railing against
pleasure, and so we will let it pass.</p>

<p>It was not usual with Signora Rivolta to
express herself with so much freedom and
cheerfulness to Markham as she did at this
interview. There had generally been something
of distance and restraint in her, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fearful of giving the young man too much
encouragement.</p>

<p>The time had been that Markham would
have been mightily pleased with this manifest
change in the deportment of Signora Rivolta;
but under present circumstances it appeared to
him that it was merely owing to the apparent
discontinuance on his part of all serious attention
to Clara; and he also felt that it would be
morally impossible for him, in the present state
of his father’s affairs, to think of making proposals.</p>

<p>With affected ease and cheerfulness he conversed
with Signora Rivolta; and with an
almost ridiculous affectation of indifference, he
took comparatively little notice of Clara. The
conversation between Markham and Signora
Rivolta was unusually animated. Matters of
taste were discussed, politics touched upon,
and theology alluded to.</p>

<p>The last was an exceedingly delicate topic.
Markham, with all his simplicity and ignorance
of what is called the world, had not been inattentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to theology. He had observed and
thought much of the influence of religion upon
the human mind; this, indeed, had been his
first and almost his only speculation. He had
been very desirous, even from early youth, of
acting and living most accurately and conscientiously.
He was as ignorant on the subject
of sectarianism as any member of an establishment
need wish to be. But sectarianism
does not spring from the attractions of heresy so
much as from the dissatisfactions of orthodoxy.
For so long as the dogmas of our own creed
please us, the arguments of another, however
ingenious, do not disturb us. Unfortunately,
however, for Markham’s orthodoxy, his native
town labored under the evil of a schism in the
church, which is far more injurious to its
stability than a schism from it. The evangelical
party was very strong and very numerous,
and very noisy; and made a great talk about
religion, and paid very great attention to church
duties and observances. Markham was a man
generally speaking much in earnest, and he
therefore gave much attention to this modification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the established theology; and had, when
a very young man, contrary to the opinion and
advice of his father and mother, sided with this
party; and he thought the other party little
better than mere indifferentists.</p>

<p>He thought he saw among the evangelical
party symptoms of the original and primitive
spirit of Christianity; and he used to say so very
freely, and to think so very seriously. And his
mother used to say, he would know better as he
grew older: and in process of time he did grow
older; and whether he thought better or not
we presume not to say; but we do know, that
as he grew older, he acquired a habit of analysing
motives and looking into principles. And
it came to pass that he found among these
evangelicals divers manifestations of a worldly
spirit, which did not exactly coincide with his
notions of extraordinary spiritual purity. In
the mercantile part of that class he saw much
that bordered very closely on trickery; in the
class a little higher, he found a mighty spirit of
conceit and priggishness. Towards their neighbours
he saw that many of them were mightily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
censorious. In conversing with some of them,
and those the ringleaders, he found that they
were prodigiously ignorant of the very principles
on which their peculiarities were founded,
and he found them to be unanimous only on
one point; namely, that their favorite clergyman
was a <em>nice man</em>.</p>

<p>At this discovery he was somewhat tempted
to smile; and as in some cases tears lead to
thought, so in others do smiles lead to reflection.
And is not this the order and ordinance of
nature? The human infancy, which is the
vestibule of intellect, is a scene commingled of
smiles and tears, of passionate sorrows and of
noisy joys; then comes reflection. So it had
been with Markham in what may be called his
theological infancy. Led by circumstances to
reflect and to think, he perhaps carried reflection
and thought farther than he first intended,
or was aware of. But it was something, and
indeed a very great matter, that he had penetration
enough to see through, what he had
charity enough to call, the unconscious mask of
fanaticism.</p>

<p>Thus led to reflection, his mind did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
hastily settle. He was entertained by various
speculations, and he made many inquiries, and
was forced to find answers for them as well as
he could. He had, as people say, his own
opinions. What those opinions were we know
not, and perhaps Markham himself did not
exactly know; and therefore, as he apprehended
these opinions indistinctly, he could not
communicate them, and thus they were likely
to continue his own. Whatever were his literal
opinions, the spirit of his theological feeling
was catholic; not Roman Catholic, gentle
reader, but catholic in its widest acceptation.
He did at one time reprobate sectarianism not
as a nurse of dangerous heresies, but as a violation
of the spirit of nature’s catholicism, and an
unauthorised earth-born enclosure of heaven’s
free blessings; but he, in time, so far surmounted
that feeling, as to discern in the constitution
of the human mind the elements of
sectarianism; and he at length came to the
dangerous conclusion, that there must needs be
diversity of opinion so long as there was diversity
of minds.</p>

<p>This state of mind will easily account for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
overlooking the theological education of Clara
Rivolta, while and when he thought of paying
court to her; and it will also serve to explain
the fact of his calmly conversing with Signora
Rivolta on subjects connected with theology.
For this good lady had also a free and liberal
spirit towards dissidents; and did think that in
religion there was something eternal and indivisible,
which humors of the day could not
limit, nor the low walls and fences of sectarianism
divide. Her faith, however, and her
devotion, however liberal might be her feelings,
were modulated and disposed according to the
religion in which she had been educated. Those
forms she preferred decidedly, but not angrily.</p>

<p>Now that part of the conversation which had
reference to theology was on the broadest and
most general principles; and the parties, so far
as they went, coincided.</p>

<p>Markham had been talking with Signora
Rivolta a long while; and he had been so
mightily well pleased with his own speculations,
freely uttered and candidly received, that he
did not notice that all this time Clara had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
perfectly silent; and that she had been attentively,
to all appearance, occupied with her
drawing.</p>

<p>But the conversation on the part of the
mother of Clara presently flagged; and the
eyes of the Signora were directed to a time-piece
that stood on a bracket in the room where
they were sitting. The index pointed to the
hour of two. Markham recollected having seen
that time-piece in poor old Richard Smith’s
cottage at Brigland; and when Signora Rivolta
looked at it so earnestly, there rushed into the
young man’s mind recollections of the past;
and he was so lost in these recollections, that he
did not think of the proper interpretation of the
Signora’s looks at the time-piece.</p>

<p>There was presently an awkward silence;
and Clara lifted up her face from the table and
looked at her mother, and saw that her mother’s
eyes were directed to the time-piece; and there
also did she look, and then suddenly her countenance
changed, and she looked again at her
mother, and slightly at Markham, and she
almost sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Markham scarcely heeded these movements
for a minute or two; but presently his recollection
came to him, and he bethought himself
that he had made an unusually long visit, and
he rose to take his departure. Then he saw,
by the manner in which Signora Rivolta received
his motion to depart, that his stay had
been quite long enough; and he was still, with
all his philosophy, so far in love with Clara,
that he fancied that she also seemed glad that
he was going. She smiled, indeed, and courteously
said, “Good morning, sir.” But if she
had not smiled, she must have sighed; and
perhaps have almost wept.</p>

<p>As Markham was retiring, he met at the
drawing-room door a strange mysterious-looking
personage, dressed in black, and having a look
of gloom and darkness far beyond any darkness
of attire. The stranger fixed his eyes inquiringly
on the young barrister, and by his
looks seemed to rebuke the young man as an
unwelcome intruder. Markham again looked
at the stranger, not from wilful curiosity and
voluntary impertinence, but almost through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
power of fascination. Never had he seen a
countenance of such singular and curious expression.
It seemed not only unenglish, but
unearthly. The eyes were large, flat, and
lustreless; the cheeks long, narrow, pendulous,
and sadly sallow; the nose aquiline; the forehead
low and wrinkled; the hair thick and
grizzled; the mouth wide, and the lips thin
and pale; and the teeth long and irregular,
and alternately black and yellow, like the keys
of an old harpsichord. Markham sickened at
the sight; he guessed what the stranger was;
and so can our readers.</p>

<div class="verse">“But here I am to speak what I do know.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Shakspeare.</span></div>

</div>

<p>Markham had a long way to walk to reach
his chambers. He went slowly, sorrowfully,
and abstractedly. He thought over and over
again of his troubles and disappointments. It
was a painful thought to him, that just at the
moment when his ambition of rising in the
world seemed about to be gratified, he should
find himself, by the misfortunes of his father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
checked, thrown back, and humiliated. It
could not but occur to his mind, that in order
to gratify him, and to place him in a profession
to which his genius and inclination directed
him, his father and mother had made many
sacrifices, and perhaps had impoverished themselves.
He could, indeed, in a pecuniary point
of view, repair the evil, at least in a great
measure; but he could not heal the wounds of
the spirit, which he saw that his father had so
deeply felt. It was not in his power to recall
the past, and restore health and spirits.</p>

<p>The young man also was perplexed and
troubled on his own account. He had long cherished,
though with some interruptions, the
prospect of obtaining the hand of Clara Rivolta.
He had, with a very pardonable, because very
common conceit, pleased himself with the imagination
that as the intellectual qualities of her
mind were of a superior character, she was
therefore most excellently well calculated for
him; and he thought it a great pity that so
intelligent a young woman should be sacrificed
to such an empty coxcomb as Tippetson. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
must pardon Markham for a little vanity: we
are all of us vain of something; and those that
are not vain of something, are vain of the
absence of vanity.</p>

<p>Among other thoughts in Markham’s mind
there now sprung up, and perhaps predominated
over all others, the thought of Clara’s
religious prejudices: for all people who differ
from ourselves have religious prejudices. That
hideous looking stranger, whom Markham met
at the door as he was parting from Clara, was
clearly a priest of the Roman Catholic church.
He looked exactly like an inquisitor; so thought
poor Markham, from whose representation we
have described the person. What a blessing it
is that Protestants have no prejudices!</p>

<p>It was a sad pity, the young man thought,
that so amiable and beautiful a creature as
Clara should be under the influence and spiritual
direction of such an ill-looking, morose,
and sour priest. He thought that her understanding
was sufficiently strong to be above the
influence of superstition; and his only fear was
the reverence in which she held her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
would overpower every other consideration, and
prevent her from giving due weight to such
arguments as might be urged against her hereditary
faith. In his own mind there was some
portion of imagination; and he could readily
understand how a system of religious faith and
ceremony, blended with early recollections and
associated with thoughts of parental kindness,
might be too powerful in its hold upon the
mind to admit of being moved or shaken by
the coldness and dryness of argument. At all
events, whatever might be Clara’s faith, and to
whatever church she might be attached, there
were other objections which rendered it not by
any means consistent with Markham’s notions
of propriety to propose or even to take any
steps towards proposing, under present circumstances.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his chambers, he found
that during his absence many inquiries had
been made for him. Among others, he saw
that Sir Andrew Featherstone had called. As
Markham had no acquaintance with, and but
little knowledge of, that worthy baronet, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
supposed that the call was one of business;
and knowing the intimacy which subsisted
between that gentleman and the Martindale
family, he thought that it might be agreeable
to the old gentleman if he should return that
call very promptly.</p>

<p>He therefore interrogated his clerk as to
whether Sir Andrew had given any intimation
of the object of his call. The clerk said that
Sir Andrew looked in low spirits, and expressed
great anxiety to see Mr. Markham, and made
very particular inquiries as to the probable
time of his return.</p>

<p>“And what answer did you give him?”
asked Markham.</p>

<p>“I told him, sir, that I could not be sure of
your return to chambers before four or five
o’clock, and that you might not then stay
longer than merely to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p>“But did not you tell him where he might
find me?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir; I said that if Sir Andrew was
very desirous of seeing you, he would probably
find you at Mr. Martindale’s house in Piccadilly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
When I mentioned Mr. Martindale’s
name he shook his head and said, ‘No, that
will not do;’ and then, after a little hesitation,
he said that he would call again in the course
of the morning.”</p>

<p>This colloquy between Markham and his
clerk was scarcely finished, when Sir Andrew
Featherstone made his appearance. The worthy
baronet was indeed very serious in his
looks; and as his usual manner was one of
great levity, his serious moods were clumsily
gloomy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markham,” said the baronet, “have
you recently seen our good old friend, Mr.
Martindale?”</p>

<p>“I saw him, Sir Andrew,” replied Markham,
“a few days ago on his way to Trimmerstone.”</p>

<p>“You have not heard from him since?” inquired
the baronet; and as he made the inquiry
he looked very grave.</p>

<p>Markham of course concluded that some
serious accident had befallen his friend, or that
he was no more. With anxious eagerness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
therefore, he asked, “I am afraid, Sir Andrew,
by this question, that you are the bearer of
some painful intelligence respecting my worthy
friend.”</p>

<p>“I certainly am, Mr. Markham; and I am
sorry to say, that, judging from the letter which
I received this morning from Mr. Martindale’s
attorney at Brigland, I fear that the poor old
gentleman is very near his end, even if he be
living at all.”</p>

<p>Markham started at the intelligence and exclaimed,
“Impossible! it is scarcely a week
since I saw him on his way to Trimmerstone in
perfect health and spirits.”</p>

<p>“But,” replied Sir Andrew, “he did not
reach Trimmerstone: he stopped short at Brigland,
where he had some matters to settle with
his confidential attorney, Mr. Price; and between
you and me, Mr. Markham,” continued
the baronet, changing his grave and solemn for
wise and mysterious looks, “I strongly suspect
that that said confidential attorney will be found
to have made of his confidence a great deal
more than it was worth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Markham was again astonished; for Markham
was a very conscientious man, and could
not readily believe many of those insinuations
which are made against divers members of the
legal profession. He thought that the greatest
pecuniary sins that could ordinarily be laid at the
door of conveyancers were a little exaggeration
in the statement of their labors, and an undue
estimate set upon their toils. Markham also
could not help observing how readily and easily
Sir Andrew Featherstone made the transition
from a serious annunciation of Mr. Martindale’s
illness and probable decease, to the hypothetical
knavery of his confidential attorney. But
why should any thing be strange to us? Simply
because we do not observe, or because observing
we do not remember.</p>

<p>Markham proceeded to inquire of Sir Andrew
Featherstone what steps it would be
desirable to take with respect to communicating
the intelligence to Signora Rivolta.</p>

<p>“That,” exclaimed Sir Andrew, “is the
difficulty. Mr. Price has requested me to
make the communication; and indeed, to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the truth, I really fear that the poor old gentleman
is no more. This is his letter.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the baronet handed to Markham
the attorney’s letter, which was in the usual common-place
style as adopted on such occasions,
and as there is nothing else common-place in
these volumes, we shall not think of violating
their uniformity by the insertion of this letter.
When Markham had read the letter, he returned
it to the baronet, saying,</p>

<p>“Indeed, Sir Andrew, from the tenor of this
letter, I am almost sure it must be as you suspect,
and our worthy friend, I fear, is no more.
It will be a painful task to communicate the information
to his family.”</p>

<p>“So indeed it will, Mr. Markham,” replied
the baronet; “and for that reason I wished to
devolve the task on you, or any one else that
would be kind enough to undertake it. I really
cannot manage these affairs so well as some people
can. I have already given a hint to the
priest that is often calling at the house, but in
truth there is very little in his look or manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that is likely to console the poor creatures. Do
you know that priest, Mr. Markham?”</p>

<p>“I believe,” replied Markham, “that I saw
him this morning for the first time in my life; for
as I was leaving the house, I met a gentleman
of clerical and morose look, who appeared as if
he was the bearer of ill tidings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very good, very good, he is the proper
person to tell them. Well, but now, Mr. Markham,
have you any idea of what will become of
Mr. Martindale’s vast property? I am very
much afraid that Price the lawyer will come in
for a great share of it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Sir Andrew,” said Markham, “I
have never given the subject a moment’s
thought; but I have no doubt that a man of
such natural acuteness as Mr. Martindale would
not suffer himself to be imposed on or deceived
by a country attorney. But what reason have
you for imagining any thing of the kind?”</p>

<p>At this question Sir Andrew Featherstone
shook his head and looked very wise; and he
seemed pleased that Markham had given him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
an opportunity of entering upon the subject by
way of explanation.</p>

<p>“Now I will tell you,” said the busy baronet;
“Mr. Martindale and I have been long acquainted
with each other, and very good friends
we used to be in our younger days; but when
Mr. Martindale came into possession of his
large property, he rather altered his behaviour
and was more distant: however, I bore no
malice, but called on him as before. In time
this shyness wore off; and one day when I was
with him at Brigland, soon after he had finished
building the Abbey, he told me that he had just
been making his will. He was always very fond
of making wills. I suppose he may have made
twenty or thirty wills in the course of his life.
Well, sir, he had been making a will, and he
wished me for one to witness the will. Now
I could not help, very naturally you know, just
giving a glance of curiosity over the sheets; and
the old gentleman said to me in his usual, hasty
manner, ‘Read the will, man, read it; I don’t
wish you to put your hand to you know not what.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
So I read it over, and signed it. I observed that
legacies are given to a very considerable amount;
and at last this fellow Price was named as one
of the executors and residuary-legatee. I could
not help remarking to Mr. Martindale that I
thought he had been over-liberal to his confidential
solicitor; for I was almost sure that by this
arrangement he would have at least one-half of
the old gentleman’s property.”</p>

<p>“But you do not mean, Sir Andrew, to say,
that Mr. Martindale was not aware of the extent
of his own property?” replied Markham.</p>

<p>“I do mean to say so,” said the baronet,
“and I am sure of the fact; and the villany of
this man Price consists in this, that knowing he
is to be residuary-legatee, he keeps or has kept
Mr. Martindale in the dark as to the real value
of his property.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Markham, “it cannot now
be helped. But it was a pity that you did not
endeavour to undeceive Mr. Martindale.”</p>

<p>“Endeavour to undeceive him? Why, my
good sir, how do you think that was possible!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
You surely were sufficiently acquainted with our
worthy friend to know that he would never be
convinced against his will.”</p>

<p>Markham smiled, and acknowledged the truth
of this remark. But the consideration now was,
what steps should be taken to ascertain the real
state of Mr. Martindale, and what farther communication
should be made to Signora Rivolta,
and who should be the bearer of the intelligence.
Sir Andrew Featherstone, by paying great compliments
to Markham’s superior understanding,
attempted to throw the burden on his shoulders;
but the young barrister, though no more adverse
to flattery than any one else, did not think a
compliment from the lips of Sir Andrew quite
sufficient recompense for the trouble of an unpleasant
embassy, and therefore gave it up to
him on whom it devolved with greater right
and propriety. Poor Sir Andrew was grievously
annoyed by his commission, but he felt himself
bound to undertake it.</p>

<p>With slow and reluctant steps the worthy
baronet proceeded from Markham’s chambers to
the town-house of Mr. Martindale; and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
he was a man of as much humanity as ninety-nine
in a hundred, he was not very sorry when
the servant who opened the door informed him
that Signora Rivolta could not be seen; for intelligence
had been just received from Brigland
of the death of Mr. Martindale.</p>

<p>It seems that the letter which Mr. Price had
written to Sir Andrew Featherstone was written
just before the decease of Mr. Martindale, and
that another had been despatched by the same
day’s post to Colonel Rivolta immediately after
the old gentleman’s departure from life. The
Colonel did not trouble himself much about
letters, and therefore handed over the communication
to Signora Rivolta, who became
thus suddenly and abruptly made acquainted
with the event which Mr. Price in his considerateness
would have conveyed to her circuitously
and gradually. For though Mr. Price
was rather cunning and dexterous as concerned
pecuniary transactions, and made the business
of conveyancing more profitable than many an
honester man would have done, yet he was by
no means an unfeeling man, or a man of rudeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
or vulgarity of manners. He was, on the
other hand, a man of great urbanity of manners,
and altogether courteous, kind and gentle in his
deportment. He never was accused or suspected
of any thing like insensibility or unkindness:
he was a most excellent father, and one of
the best of husbands; and though he was not
exceedingly conscientious in pecuniary affairs,
he still would never have enriched himself at the
expense of another’s misery and obvious sufferings.
But when the affairs of old Mr. Martindale
were put into his hands, and when he saw
that the old gentleman’s property was so much
beyond his wants and beyond his ideas, a temptation
was thus presented to the man of law to
take some little advantage of this ignorance.</p>

<p>As Mr. Martindale frequently amused himself
with making wills, and as in all these
drafts and directions he had uniformly stated
that Mr. Price was to be one of his executors
and residuary-legatee, the conveyancer thought
it might be politic still to keep the old gentleman
in the dark as to the real value and extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of his property. There is a casuistry which might
represent such conduct as being perfectly honest;
but we deal not in casuistry, and therefore we
leave it with the stamp of our reprobation; and
very much, no doubt, such men as Mr. Price
will care for our reprobation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Before we remove the scene of our narrative
to Brigland again, it will be necessary to
let our readers into the secret of the ill-omened
appearance of the priest, at whose aspect our
friend Markham so instinctively shuddered.</p>

<p>If the slight and occasional notice which we
have taken of Clara Rivolta’s character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
circumstances have conveyed to the minds of
our readers those impressions which we have
designed that it should convey; they will see that
the poor girl, from circumstances over which
she had no control, and from a natural timidity
and diffidence, had been painfully and severely
tried. They will also readily imagine that she
had experienced no slight inconvenience from
the difference between the religion of her birthplace
and the religion of her present home.
They will easily imagine that her mind could
not be so passionately and fervently devoted to
the old religion as was the mind of her mother;
and they will also be able to apprehend that she
could not be very hostile to the faith which
Markham professed. Now, though Signora
Rivolta was a woman of good natural understanding,
of great discernment, and of strong
mind; and though she could reason well and
talk liberally, yet she had by constitutional
temperament a strong tincture of fanaticism.
Her mind was naturally enthusiastic; and
though fanaticism and enthusiasm may be
managed with a better grace in minds of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
exalted character than in those of inferior
powers, yet where these feelings do exist in
strong and superior minds they are exceedingly
obstinate and unchangeable. It was therefore
with no agreeable feelings that Signora Rivolta
had contemplated the possibility, and indeed
the great probability, that her daughter would
give her hand to a Protestant.</p>

<p>A conversation which the mother of Clara
once had with Lady Woodstock on this subject
by no means reconciled her to the anticipation.
The substance of the conversation was as
follows: Lady Woodstock had prevailed with
Clara for two or three successive Sundays to
attend with her at Mr. Henderson’s chapel;
and on their return from the chapel one morning,
Lady Woodstock observing that Signora Rivolta
looked unusually morose, addressed her
as if her ill looks were from mere bodily indisposition.</p>

<p>“My dear Signora, I am afraid you are not
well this morning.”</p>

<p>“Lady Woodstock, I am unwell; but it is
the malady of mind. I am not pleased that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
my daughter should forsake the religion in
which she was educated. I have not seen in
this country sufficient proofs that the Protestant
religion is so superior to the Catholic,
as to make me wish that my daughter should
renounce the faith of her native land.”</p>

<p>Lady Woodstock was not one of those good-humored
people who are never out of humor
except when they are displeased: her good-humor
was perpetual; and it was by no means
her habit to snatch eagerly at an opportunity
of being affronted. With the greatest cheerfulness
of manner, therefore, she replied to this
pettish speech of Signora Rivolta.</p>

<p>“My very good lady, why should you imagine
that I have any wish to withdraw your
daughter from her own religion? But even
suppose that such an event should take place,
you are not so illiberally inclined as to believe
that salvation is not attainable in the Protestant
church; and as it is not impossible that your
daughter may be married to a Protestant, it is
well that she should at least learn to regard that
religion with complacency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother of Clara was by no means softened
by that reply, but with unabated asperity
replied, “I must entreat you, my Lady Woodstock,
not to speak so slightingly of religion.
Would you have a woman renounce her religion
for a husband?”</p>

<p>“I think seriously,” said Lady Woodstock,
“that the religion of the wife should conform
to that of the husband.”</p>

<p>“Abominable!” exclaimed Signora Rivolta.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my good friend, I see nothing so
very abominable in the matter. No woman
ought to marry a man whose religion will be
his condemnation; and the religion which may
be made effectual to the salvation of the husband
is equally capable of saving the wife.”</p>

<p>“Sophistry, not worth refuting;” was the
only answer which Signora Rivolta made to this
last speech.</p>

<p>The cause of this ill-humor in the mother of
Clara, and of this ebullition of bigotry, was the
appearance in London of an Italian priest
named Martini, whom Signora Rivolta had
known in Italy, and from whose fanaticism her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
mind had received there a strong religious impulse.
This Father Martini had, on the Sunday
morning in question, officiated at the
chapel where Signora Rivolta attended, and
his discourse had been on the subject of religious
indifference; and that part of religious
indifference on which priests are most eloquent,
and with which they are generally most angry,
is an inattention to sectarian theories or peculiarities.
By the eloquence of Father Martini
the zeal of Signora Rivolta had been revived,
and with that zeal there also arose a feeling of
hostility and bitterness towards heretics.</p>

<p>This conversation took place just after the
elopement of the Countess of Trimmerstone
with Mr. Tippetson: and as after that event
Horatio Markham, from circumstances already
noticed, did not pay such constant attention as
in former days he had paid to Clara, Signora
Rivolta began to have hopes that the attachment
on Markham’s part was dying away.
With respect to Clara, it was evident that her
mind was in a painfully unsettled state; and
her mother thought that no better remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
could be applied, than removing her from those
scenes and associations from whence her unhappiness
arose; and as Father Martini was a
man of some consideration in his own country,
and a person in whom the Signora could confide,
it entered into her mind that it might be
desirable to send Clara back to her native land
under his guardianship, till such time as in the
revolution of events Colonel Rivolta and herself
might be able to return to Italy.</p>

<p>It would indeed have been a gratification to
her mother, could Clara have been easily induced
to take the veil; but the Signora had
more consideration for her daughter’s feelings
than to use, or to suffer to be used, any urgent
importunities on the subject. And here we are
quite willing and most happy to render to
Signora Rivolta the justice which acknowledges
and commends the gentle and unimportunate
mode in which her wishes on this subject were
always expressed. Every body knows that
there is a mode of importunity which wearies
and worries into compliance, when the judgment
and inclination are equally and strongly adverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to that compliance. And this importunity is so
expressed, and with such jesuitical dexterity is
it oftentimes managed, that when it has gained
its object, its victim is thought and spoken of
as acting from its own free will. Beautifully
is this importunity pictured in that touching
song called “Auld Robin Gray.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“My mither didna speak,</div>
<div class="verse">But she looked in my face</div>
<div class="verse">Till my heart was nigh to break.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now there was no such species of tender
worrying as this in Signora Rivolta’s conduct
towards her daughter. The Signora was somewhat
fanatical, but she was straightforward and
honest.</p>

<p>The presence of Father Martini in London at
this juncture certainly led the mother of Clara
to thoughts concerning her daughter; and,
knowing that Mr. Martindale was not very
partial to the priests of her religion, she took
occasion of his absence to hold frequent intercourse
with this zealous supporter and advocate
of that faith in which she had been educated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Father Martini had made frequent visits, and
had held long consultations. In those consultations
mention had been made of Markham
and Tippetson; and when the priest made the
last visit, he took it for granted that the person
whom he met at the drawing-room door was
Markham: for that reason he looked at him
with such inquisitorial scrutiny.</p>

<p>It has been stated that Sir Andrew Featherstone
had met this Father Martini, and had
informed him of the dangerous state in which
Mr. Martindale was, at Brigland. This information
the priest of course conveyed to Signora
Rivolta. But before he had well finished
speaking, a letter came from Brigland, addressed
to Colonel Rivolta, and by him it was
immediately handed over to the Signora.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the information, and the
unexpectedness of the event, gave a painful
shock to her feelings. At the first meeting of
father and daughter, as mentioned in an early
part of our narrative, there was comparatively
little emotion. They had not been acquainted
with or accustomed to each other, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
all the emotion which was excited was merely
by force of imagination, in which faculty neither
of them much abounded. But when Signora
Rivolta had resided for a year or two with her
lately-discovered father, and had experienced
from him so much more kindness, attention,
and even homage, than the circumstances of
her birth could have led her to anticipate;
when she had observed in his mind those traits
and features, which are really and substantially
good; and when she had seemed to be essential
to his happiness and comfort: then indeed it
was painful to her that he had been thus suddenly
snatched away from her, and that he had
breathed his last at a distance from every relative;
and that the only farewell had been the
parting for a short journey.</p>

<p>When Signora Rivolta had read the letter,
she gave it to her daughter, and covered her
face, and wept bitterly, but not loudly. The
contents of the letter were thus made known to
Clara before she read it. There is sometimes
a consolation springing from the suddenness of
an afflictive announcement; for if the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
shock is well sustained, the details and particulars
frequently act as alleviations. But Clara’s
nerves were not strong, and her susceptibility
was acute; and as her mother was not ordinarily
passionate in grief or profuse of tears, the
deep sobbings which the poor girl now witnessed
overcame her self-possession, and she
uttered a slight scream and fainted. The usual
restoratives were promptly applied, and the
stern-looking Father Martini was deeply moved
at the scene of distress before him.</p>

<p>Clara was presently removed to her own
apartment; and when she was sufficiently
recovered to be left alone, Signora Rivolta
returned to the priest. Now though this man
had a stern and forbidding aspect, and though
he was most zealously and exclusively devoted
to that form of Christianity which he professed,
yet he had the kindly feelings of humanity
about him; and even the sternness of his
bigotry had mercy for its motive.</p>

<p>“Lady,” said the priest to Signora Rivolta,
“I can pity you. I can make allowance for
the frailty and weakness of human feeling; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
you must, in the midst of your grief, remember
and adore the hand which sends affliction.
And you should consider whether there be not
some peculiar spiritual good to be derived and
drawn from temporal and worldly sorrow. You
have lost a parent. Pray for his soul. His
errors might have shaken the stability of your
faith; and if he endeavoured, while living,
to poison your soul with heresy, now return
good for evil, and pray for him. Who can
tell how much the prayers of the faithful may
avail!”</p>

<p>Signora Rivolta listened calmly, and replied,
“But, father, will my prayers be successful for
a heretic?”</p>

<p>“Daughter,” replied the priest, “there are
no heretics in the grave.”</p>

<p>There was a pause in the conversation; and
Father Martini anxiously watched the countenance
of Signora Rivolta to see when there
might be an opportunity of speaking concerning
the daughter, of the steadiness of whose faith
there was some ground of doubt. As there
appeared some symptoms of composure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
priest, after a short interval, said, “Daughter,
when afflictions come upon us, it is for our own
good, or for the good of the church, most frequently
for both. You have a child who was
brought up in the bosom of the holy church;
the faith of that child has been endangered.
It is now more than ever in your power to
secure and establish it. Whereinsoever you
doubt your own influence in this land of heresy,
that defect may be supplied and that evil
remedied by removal of your child into a
country where heresy is unknown.”</p>

<p>There followed this address a much longer
and more embarrassing interval of silence,
which at length was slowly broken by Signora
Rivolta in a subdued and almost whispering
tone. “Father Martini, I reverence the faith
in which I have been reared from my infancy,
and I feel it to be a faith of holy and sustaining
power; but I fear that it has no influence
where it does not rule the will; and I cannot,
dare not, use an importunity of persuasion to
urge my child to the steps which you suggest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
If the church receives her wholly, it shall
receive her freely.”</p>

<p>At this speech there was a slight frown upon
the brow of the holy man; but Signora Rivolta
saw it not, nor was she aware of any unpleasant
feeling in the mind of Father Martini, when in
reply he said, “Lady, you, as a mother, have
power to influence; and the influence which
you can use is more than authority and weightier
than command. A child cannot long resist a
parent.”</p>

<p>With much quickness and promptitude, Signora
Rivolta replied, “My child shall not
resist me.”</p>

<p>Father Martini was pleased; and with an
agreeable feeling he rose to take his leave,
saying, “Now, lady, I leave you; and when
you have performed your duty to the dead,
you will not forget your duty also to the
living.”</p>

<p>There was a meaning in the Signora’s last
expression which the priest did not observe.
To his ear it sounded as if it was intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
say that resistance would be hopeless and ineffectual.
From the lips of Clara’s mother it
was intended to say, that no importunity of
persuasion should be used. It was a pleasant
misunderstanding on both sides.</p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Harte.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Signora Rivolta, in her present circumstances,
felt it absolutely necessary to send for
Markham, in order to avail herself of his
advice as to what steps were now to be taken:
for even if the Colonel had been a man of
business and decision, he was almost, if not
entirely, a stranger to the laws and manners of
England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Markham immediately obeyed the summons,
and accompanied the family to Brigland. At
his suggestion they first called upon the
clergyman, Mr. Denver. From him Markham
supposed that they should be able to
gather the particulars of Mr. Martindale’s
death better than from talkative and ignorant
domestics, and less frigidly narrated than by a
calculating scrivener. The young barrister
also supposed that Mr. Denver’s thirst for
knowledge might have put him into possession
of all the particulars; and he knew that nothing
so tended to the abatement of sorrow as a little
ingenious circumstantiality. In these expectations
Markham was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Mr. Denver received the party with great
ceremony and formality; and though exceedingly
sorry for the death of his good friend Mr.
Martindale, he could not help being very much
gratified by this mark of respect and consideration,
nor could he well conceal his sense of the
honor that was done him by this call. He
addressed himself principally to Mr. Markham,
having been previously acquainted with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and regarding him as the mouth and ear of the
party.</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, this is indeed a serious loss to us
all. I little thought when poor Mr. Martindale
sent for me last Monday morning, what
was his object in wishing to see me.”</p>

<p>“Was he taken ill on Monday morning?”
interrupted Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no sir; on Monday morning he
was as well as you are at this moment. But it
happened very curiously, that last Sunday Mr.
Martindale came to church, and I preached a
sermon on the uncertainty of human life. It is
a sermon that I generally preach at this time of
year. But Mr. Martindale, who was not much
in the habit of attending church, had by some
strange fatality heard this sermon twice before.
Now, you know, sir,” continued Mr. Denver,
addressing himself to Mr. Markham, “that
our late friend was not much in the habit of
taking notice of sermons. He used to say, in
his odd manner, that one sermon was as good
as another, for they all gave more good advice
than any of the hearers followed. Well, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he sent for me, as I was saying, and as soon as
I entered the room, (he was sitting in the bow-windowed
drawing-room that overlooks the
park,) he rose from the sofa, on which he
usually sat, between the fire-place and window,
and he took me by the hand, and without
giving me time to speak, he drew a chair with
his other hand, and almost pushed me into it,
saying, ‘There, sit down, I want to talk to
you.’ So I waited a few seconds, and then
said, ‘I shall be exceedingly happy to attend
to any commands which you may think fit to
honor me with.’ Without making any direct
answer to what I said, and as if he was not
aware that I had spoken at all, he said,
‘How often have you preached that sermon
which I heard yesterday?’ I smiled at the
singularity of the question&mdash;Mr. Martindale
used, you know, to ask very singular questions&mdash;and
I said in answer, ‘I cannot tell exactly
how often; but it has not been preached, I
believe, oftener than any other.’&mdash;‘Perhaps
not,’ he replied immediately; ‘but as I have
heard it three times, it sounded to me yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
as a kind of warning, and I have a notion that
I am not far from my end.’ I tried all I could
to divert his mind from such gloomy thoughts,
but nothing that I could say produced any
effect whatever. I said to him, ‘I hope, sir,
that you do not feel yourself unwell.’&mdash;‘Unwell!’
he replied, ‘to be sure I do. I am an
old man; and old age is a disease that must end
in death.’&mdash;‘But, sir,’ said I again, ‘though
you may be advanced in years, yet you enjoy a
tolerably good state of health; and there are
many persons much older than you who enjoy
a very great share of health and a good flow of
spirits, and why then, sir, should you cherish
such gloomy thoughts?’”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Denver paused for a moment, and
his countenance changed to a still graver expression,
when clasping his hands together, and
then spreading them out, and lifting up his eyes,
he resumed his narrative, saying,</p>

<p>“If I live to the age of Methuselah I shall
never forget the impressive and energetic manner
in which Mr. Martindale replied. Before
I had well finished speaking, he hastily caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
up my words, and said, ‘Many persons older
than me! Ay, sir, and there have been persons
younger than me or you who on Monday
morning have been in apparently perfect health,
and on Saturday have been corpses. Now, sir,
you preached to me yesterday, give me leave
to preach to you to-day. I recommend to
you for the future not to contradict on Monday
what you have been preaching on the Sunday.
Yesterday you exhorted me most solemnly to
prepare for death, and to-day you are doing all in
your power to divert my thoughts from the contemplation
of mortality.’ There was a degree
of seriousness in that rebuke which I felt to be
irresistible; and I said no more. Our late
friend then proceeded to mention several other
matters of a worldly nature, and your name,
sir, was very frequently mentioned; am I at
liberty to go on with that part of my narrative?”</p>

<p>This interrogation was addressed to Markham,
who immediately and almost quickly said,
“By all means, Mr. Denver, by all means. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
beg you would not hesitate about the use of my
name.”</p>

<p>“Your fathers name also was mentioned,”
said the clergyman.</p>

<p>Markham supposed, therefore, that some allusion
had been made to his father’s embarrassments,
and that on that account Mr. Denver
felt some delicacy in speaking of the subject.
As, however, Markham was well aware that nothing
known to Mr. Denver could long be kept
a secret, he gave full permission for any and
every thing to be repeated which Mr. Martindale
had said. On this leave, the rector of
Brigland continued his narrative.</p>

<p>“Changing the subject from spiritual to temporal
matters, Mr. Martindale then said, ‘Now,
sir, I wish to make some alteration in my will
in favor of two good friends of mine; and I am
not willing to send for Mr. Price on this occasion,
because I am desirous of making the alteration
in his favor. He is a scrupulous man, and
he would plague me with his modest refusals
and opposition: so I shall execute it all myself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
but I must have witnesses to the alteration,
and you must find me some. The other friend
whom I wish to put into my will, I believe you
know. You dined with him here some time ago,
soon after the trial in which my cousin was so
unpleasantly engaged.’ I replied, ‘I know
the gentleman, sir, to whom you allude, I remember
him perfectly well.’ Mr. Martindale
then proceeded, and as you wish to hear all the
particulars, he said, ‘I have lately seen the
young man very properly and suitably engaged
in attending on his sick father; and from what
I could learn before I left the town, I have
reason to believe…’”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Denver hesitated, and Markham
colored. The latter, however, had sufficient
presence of mind to say, “I beg you will
proceed; I am sure that Mr. Martindale could
never have made any unhandsome or illiberal
observations, or that indeed he could have said
any thing which I could object to hear.”</p>

<p>“His observations,” continued Mr. Denver,
“were not illiberal; but I felt some delicacy in
alluding to the subject. Yet as you wish me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
continue, I will add, that Mr. Martindale did
say that he thought that there was something
more than bodily illness, and that he had made
such inquiries and had received such information
as gave him a very high opinion of the parties
concerned. He then said, that he was desirous
of putting the name of Mr. Markham in his
will. At his request, and totally unknown to
Mr. Price, I fetched three gentlemen to witness
the alteration of the will. When the gentlemen
arrived, Mr. Martindale said to them, ‘Now,
my good friends, I have requested the favor of
your attendance to witness a transaction in
which you have no interest; but I hope you
will not on that account refuse to indulge an old
man’s whims.’ For these were the same gentlemen
who had witnessed the will which had
been drawn out by Mr. Price. The gentlemen
of course expressed their readiness to attend to
the business on which they had been brought
together; and then Mr. Martindale said to them,
‘Now, gentlemen, I am a capricious old man,
and I wish to make some slight alteration in
what I have called my last will and testament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
but as the alteration concerns my worthy friend
Price, I thought it best not to let him know
any thing about the matter.’ He then produced
the will, and read it over very distinctly;
making as he went on many curious remarks,
till when at last he reached the close of it he
said, ‘Now I have here left Price residuary-legatee
and executor; by which arrangement he
will come into about ten or fifteen thousand
pounds. But as there has been some change of
circumstances which may render superfluous
some of these legacies, and as Mr. Price does
not reside in town, I have designed to make this
alteration, namely, to put down his name as a
legatee for twenty thousand, and to throw the
burden of executorship and the chance of what
may remain on my young friend, Horatio Markham
of the Inner Temple.’”</p>

<p>Markham recollected, as who could not?
the observation which had been made to him
by Sir Andrew Featherstone concerning the
trickery of Mr. Price, in keeping the old gentleman
in ignorance of the real value and extent
of his property, in order to take advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of that ignorance for his own benefit. When,
however, it appeared that Markham was put in
that position, it excited in his mind emotions
not easily suppressed. Not designing however
to take undue advantage of this disposition, he
commanded his feelings, and suffered Mr. Denver
to proceed.</p>

<p>“The alteration of the will was then made,
and duly signed and attested. The will was then
committed to the care of Mr. Simpson, the
banker, and the party who had witnessed it
were requested to stay and dine at the cottage;
and nobody could appear in better spirits or in
better health than Martindale then did. He
was quite as full of humor as ever; and he
laughed and joked about the great house, for
that was the name by which he always called
the Abbey; and he several times said, ‘I
think I must make another alteration in the
will, and leave that foolish building for a public
hospital, or for a madhouse; for it is only fit for
crazy folks to inhabit.’ Then he said to us,
‘Have you any idea what that ridiculous mass
of building cost me?’ And one said one sum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and another said another; and then the old gentleman
laughed out and said, ‘Ay, ay, you
may guess as long as you please, but you will
never hit the mark, for upon my word I don’t
know myself: for, in fact, before it was half
finished, I was so much ashamed of my folly, I
endeavoured to avoid knowing the amount of the
expense.’ And thus quite in good-humor and
high spirits did the old gentleman continue till
it was past eleven o’clock, and even then he
would hardly suffer us to take leave of him.
The next morning I called to see him, and he
was quite as well as ever, and did not take any
notice of what had passed the day before; he
only said, ‘Well, Mr. Denver, I am going down
to Trimmerstone to inspect the repairs at the
hall; but I will take care not to make such a
fool’s hutch as that great house over the way.’
After I had been gone about an hour or more,
a messenger came to fetch me again to go up to
the cottage. Then I found Mr. Martindale extremely
ill; a violent paralysis had seized him,
and he was nearly speechless. It was with the
utmost difficulty that he could be understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Mr. Price was there, and was really as much
affected as if it had been his own father. It
was absolutely impossible to take any commands
from Mr. Martindale himself, and Mr. Price
thought it best to apprise his relations of the
danger in which he was lying. For this purpose
he despatched immediately a letter to Sir
Andrew Featherstone, that he might gradually
break the affair to them. But that letter had
been scarcely sent off, when poor Mr. Martindale
had a second attack, and in less than an
hour he ceased to live. It is impossible for me
to express what I felt upon this occasion. The
language which he had used to me on the
preceding day occurred so forcibly to my mind,
it seemed as though it were quite prophetic.”</p>

<p>Mr. Denver finished his narration, which was
attended to by Signora Rivolta not without
some emotion. She felt much more deeply at
this recital of her father’s decease than she had
at the discovery of his existence. Clara too
felt very sorry for her loss; for there had
always been about her grandfather a peculiarly
kind and gentle manner. He was an odd man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
certainly; but if odd men have amiable qualities,
their very oddness renders these good qualities
more impressive and beautiful. Clara relied
upon his judgment, and was delighted with the
kindness of his heart. Clara was one who
loved prodigies; and to her imaginative mind
old Mr. Martindale was a prodigy of wisdom
and benevolence. Clara might possess judgment
as well as imagination; but she was not
always aware of the precise line which divided
them, and she sometimes mistook the promptings
of the one for the decisions of the other.</p>

<p>The construction and arrangement of the external
world is beautifully adapted to the
varieties of minds which contemplate it, and the
diversities of feelings which delight to be interested.
If there be in any mind a love of the
wonderful, there is abundant supply of it. If
there be a delight in uniformity, there is also a
uniformity precise beyond the utmost stretch of
mathematical conception; and amidst human
character there is also a delightful abundance
of varied interest: for the sensibility which is
most happy in tears, may also find sorrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
wherewith to sympathise; the humor that is
disposed to indulge itself in laughter, lacks not
a liberal harvest of absurdities; the censorious,
whose virtues consist in railing at others’ vices,
never are at a loss for some vices to reprove;
and those who like Clara Rivolta are delighted
with romantically beautiful specimens of exalted
moral character, may always find them.</p>

<p>It was then determined by the party that the
gentlemen should proceed to the cottage, and
take the necessary steps for arranging the
funeral of their deceased friend, and that the
ladies should remain at the house of Mr.
Denver.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At the cottage the party found the Earl of
Trimmerstone and Mr. Price in very close and
serious conversation. They were discussing
the arrangements for the funeral; but they
seemed pleased at the addition to their party;
and in the manner of Lord Trimmerstone towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Markham and Colonel Rivolta, there did
not appear the slightest symptom of jealousy,
or the least coolness or haughtiness.</p>

<p>After what Markham had heard of the will,
and after comparing what Sir Andrew Featherstone
had said with what had been related by
Mr. Denver, he did not feel himself altogether
at ease. For though he was very sure that
Lord Trimmerstone was not aware of it, yet he
could not feel perfectly composed, from the
anticipation of what his lordship might say or
think when he should know it, as very soon he
must. On this occasion there were feelings in
Markham’s mind by no means of an enviable
nature. He unpleasantly and even painfully
recollected that he had been always opposed to
Lord Trimmerstone, and that without any deliberate
wish or intention on his part; and he
could not but imagine that a person of rank
like Lord Trimmerstone, having also, as his
lordship certainly had, exalted notions of the
dignity and glory of title, must be greatly
mortified at being brought into opposition with
a person of no family. Markham’s first acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
with the name and family of Martindale
had been, as we have narrated, merely
from professional employment. His acquaintance
and intimacy with the old gentleman had
been not his own seeking; and even had he
been disposed to drop the acquaintance, it was
never in his power to do so without manifest
rudeness, and almost downright ingratitude.
It was not Markham’s wish to be quoted as a
pattern, or to be set up against a relative of his
accidentally-acquired friend. But the most
mortifying circumstance of all was the last act
of old Mr. Martindale; for by the will recently
made, there seemed ready to fix upon Markham
an indelible stigma as a legacy-hunter. The
real circumstances of the case he hardly knew;
and he could not, on the information of Sir
Andrew Featherstone, accuse Mr. Price, in
order to exonerate himself. It was also very
well known that though Mr. Price was confidential
solicitor to Mr. Martindale, yet as the
old gentleman was a kind of amateur lawyer,
he was very fond of talking on legal subjects
with Markham, and did very often quote his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
opinion, to which he gave especial weight and
importance.</p>

<p>It was also unpleasant and almost distressing
to Markham to notice how very courteously
Lord Trimmerstone behaved to him, and indeed
always had he behaved so. It was very unfortunate,
but there appeared no remedy for it,
that with the best and purest intentions on the
part of the young barrister, he should be
brought into such awkward and almost unexplainable
difficulties. For Markham was not
only a man of strict integrity, but he had also
a very high degree of moral susceptibility, and
was excessively anxious to possess a high moral
reputation: perhaps it was unfortunate for
him that his regard to appearances was so great.
His object might have been ultimately as well
answered had he paid his undivided attention
to the substance, leaving the shadow to take
care of itself. Our readers will perceive that in
what we have here said concerning our friend
Markham, that he possessed a small share of
vanity: as however he had many truly excellent
qualities, that may be pardoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Now when Markham and his companions
were thus cordially received, the whole party
went into a consultation respecting the mode of
the funeral; for as Mr. Price had said that
there was no mention in the will of any desire
on the part of the deceased as to funeral ceremony,
the matter was open to discussion. In
this consultation, Lord Trimmerstone and Mr.
Markham were principally engaged; and it
ended by resolving to have the funeral as plain
as consistent with circumstances. This plainness
was however composed of all the funereal
practicabilities of Brigland.</p>

<p>Mr. Denver hearing that Mr. Price had
spoken of the will, ventured to say that there
existed a will of later date than that to which
Mr. Price alluded. At the mention of this
Mr. Price turned exceedingly pale; nor was
his agitation much alleviated by hearing that
one purpose of this new will was to increase
the bequest designed for himself.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Mr. Denver,” said the man of law,
trembling, “why that is very odd. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that Mr. Martindale made several wills at
different times, but this which I have was made
so very recently, that there must be something
very extraordinary to have occasioned it, and
it is so strange that I should not have heard
of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Denver hoping to surprise agreeably
said, “The making of the will to which I refer
was concealed from you, Mr. Price, out of a
feeling of delicacy, that Mr. Martindale might
not hear from you those objections to an increased
legacy, which he took it for granted
you would make, if the alteration of the will
were given to you to draw up. So Mr. Martindale
said that he would make his own will, and
then you might see after his decease how highly
he valued your services.”</p>

<p>To this speech Mr. Price bowed, but no very
strong symptoms of satisfaction were manifest
in his countenance. Lord Trimmerstone immediately
despatched a messenger for Mr.
Simpson, requesting him to bring with him the
document which had been committed to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
care by the late Mr. Martindale. The gentleman
presently obeyed the summons, and the
will in question was produced.</p>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone cast his eye upon it, and
hastily turned over, the very few folios which
contained it, and with unaltered look said, “I
see no mention made of funeral directions, and
therefore we may proceed in our arrangements
as before. Mr. Simpson, I will commit the
will to your care; and after the funeral it may
be read over, in the hearing of such of the
parties concerned as may be present on the
occasion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson received the paper, bowed, and
retired. And as it would require a pen far
more practised than ours to give interest to the
discussion which followed the retiring of this
gentleman, we will proceed to the day of the
funeral.</p>

<p>In opposition to the opinion and persuasions
of Lord Trimmerstone, Signora Rivolta almost
insisted on being present on the occasion.
Clara followed her mother’s example, moved
by the same considerations, and prompted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
similar feelings. They both felt respect and
love to the deceased; and the mother of Clara
observed, “You will destroy the very character
of funereal rites if you exclude those whose
sorrow for the loss is greatest.”</p>

<p>“It is on that very account, madam,” replied
Lord Trimmerstone, “that we wish to
persuade you from attending at the interment.
Why should you wish to render your regrets
more poignant? and why should you encounter
a scene which will be affliction to you, and
beneficial to no one?”</p>

<p>“My lord, that which is matter of feeling is
not subject for argument. I know that I shall
feel deeply and painfully when I stand by my
father’s grave; and I believe that my tears
there will be joy to no one: but I also know
that there may be many hours in life, in which
to have shed these tears on such an occasion
and at such a place will be to me a pleasure.”</p>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone did not exactly understand
how that was to be; but he knew very
well that it was not the fashion for females to
attend funerals, and he thought it was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
absurd in Signora Rivolta to persist in such a
request. His lordship did not exactly know
why it was not fashionable, and perhaps never
thought of inquiring. It is the spirit and glory
of fashion to follow models and obey laws,
without knowing why or wherefore. The true
reason of the unfashionableness of that which
Signora Rivolta and her daughter persisted in
doing is, that emotion and deep feeling are unfashionable.
The Earl of Trimmerstone did
not pursue the course of opposition, on finding
that the ladies were sincere and earnest in
their wish to pay this last tribute of respect to
their departed relative.</p>

<p>The funeral service was read by Mr. Denver;
who, notwithstanding he did all that he possibly
could in order to render the service impressive
by reading it solemnly, still from a habit of
hastily performing the various parts of clerical
duty, was absolutely unable to give the full
effect to it. Signora Rivolta felt the defect of
pathos, and the absence of genuine solemnity.
This defect might perhaps contribute to keep
her own feelings more calm and composed; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
rather, by rendering her somewhat angry with
the apparent indifference of the officiating
clergyman, it tended to excite other emotions
than merely those of grief and sorrow of heart.</p>

<p>When the last rites were over, it was necessary
that the will should be read. If there was
any one of the party apprehensive of disappointment,
that person must have been Lord Trimmerstone.
It certainly must have been mortifying
to him to have witnessed the obstructions
to his prospects of inheritance; first, in the
discovery of his relative’s daughter and family,
and next in the patronage and favoritism of
that man whom he knew only as a person professionally
employed against himself. It was
mortifying also to him to think that this favorite
should have become such from the very circumstance
which his lordship had most reason to
look back upon with shame and regret. It is,
indeed, much to his lordship’s credit, that
notwithstanding all these things he never
manifested any symptoms of ill-humor or hostility
towards the parties concerned, and never
had recourse to any arts or contrivances whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to flatter the old gentleman into good-humor.
All this, however meritorious as it
may sound in description, did not spring from
any magnanimity on the part of Lord Trimmerstone,
nor was it accompanied with any moral
effort or reflective thought; it arose purely
from a natural indolence of mind, and from a
feeling that Mr. Martindale, who had manifested
some zeal in procuring a higher title for
his dependent relative, would have a natural
desire to do what he could for the aggrandisement
of the family that bore his own name.</p>

<p>The will was read. It commenced in the
usual form. It gave various legacies to servants
and humble friends, which need not be
specified; it then went on to the distribution of
larger and more important bequests; it gave
the estate at Trimmerstone, and two other
estates in the adjoining county, together with
fifty thousand pounds, to the Earl of Trimmerstone.
It assigned to Signora Rivolta an estate
of two thousand a year; to Clara, a legacy of
five thousand pounds; to his worthy and confidential
solicitor, Mr. Price of Brigland, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sum of twenty thousand pounds; and to Horatio
Markham, the residue: appointing the two last-named
as his executors.</p>

<p>With this arrangement the Earl of Trimmerstone
was perfectly satisfied; and had such a
bequest come into his possession a few years
before, he might have been delighted with it:
but the time for his feeling strong emotions
was past; his spirit was broken, and life had
with him ceased to be holiday-time. Of the
other legatees, Signora Rivolta, considering the
circumstances of her birth, and recollecting the
fears and prospects with which she had landed
in England, was also perfectly satisfied. Markham,
not knowing the extent of his legacy, but
almost sorry that his name should have appeared
at all in the document, felt embarrassed, and
really did most heartily wish that what Sir
Andrew Featherstone had told him might prove
untrue: for the barrister, who would have
delighted in opulence, as the result of professional
diligence and skill, was not pleased at
owing his wealth to a capricious stranger; and
as it was his determination not to avail himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of this bequest, should it prove unreasonably
large, he was greatly disturbed at the idea
that by giving or offering it to those whom he
thought the right owners, he should seem to be
playing a part of ostentatious heroism.</p>

<p>But, alas! for poor Mr. Price! His disappointment
was severe indeed. Ever since he
had had the management of Mr. Martindale’s
property, he had been playing a deep game.
It was his object to acquire a character with
the old gentleman for strict and delicate honesty.
He perceived that his employer was not fully
aware of the value of his own property, and he
saw that it was possible that advantage might
be taken of this ignorance. But the crafty
solicitor also knew that Mr. Martindale was a
man of shrewd sense and great self-will; and
therefore thought it most advisable so to manage
and conduct the affairs, that if by any freak on
the part of the rich man, there should be necessity
for explanation and full statement, that
explanation and that statement might be made
without fear of disgrace and suspicion. By the
habit of accuracy in his accounts, the lawyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
became absolutely proud of the dexterity and
scrupulosity with which he had attended to the
affairs of his client; and oftentimes did he urge
Mr. Martindale to pay more personal attention,
and to inspect the accounts.</p>

<p>The old gentleman’s personal expenditure
had been but trifling, compared with his actual
income. Wishing, however, to be liberal, but
still desirous of keeping that liberality within
his income, he had made frequent and periodical
inquiries of his lawyer as to the extent of the
means; and the answers to these inquiries had
always been very much within the mark.
Very soon after Mr. Martindale had begun to
employ Mr. Price as his confidential solicitor,
the whim of will-making had seized the old
gentleman; and in all the instructions which
he had given to his lawyer for that purpose,
Mr. Price had been uniformly named as executor
and residuary-legatee. The policy of
that gentleman had therefore been to keep Mr.
Martindale as much in the dark as he conveniently
could with respect to the real extent
and value of his property. But unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
for himself, the confidential solicitor overacted
his part; and by causing his employer to apprehend
that the residue of his property, after
various proposed bequests, would be very much
less than it really was, he had led the old gentleman
to make the alteration above named.</p>

<p>Now it may seem that a legacy of twenty
thousand pounds to a provincial solicitor was a
bequest by no means to be despised or lamented.
It may be said that this was better than nothing;
but of that we have our doubts. Money is
more or less, according to circumstances; and
to ninety-nine persons out of a hundred, the
disappointment of an expectation is equivalent
to an actual loss. In the present case, however,
Mr. Price was not merely disappointed,
but he was absolutely embarrassed and perplexed:
for he had made purchases of land at
a great expense, and had left so large a portion
of the purchase-money as a burden on his purchases,
that the rent of his estates barely sufficed
to pay the interest; and in some cases
actually fell short of it. Add to this, that
since the property in question had been bought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the change in its value had been by no means
in favor of the purchaser. The legacy therefore
which had been left him, magnificent as it
might appear, compared with his apparent circumstances,
was far below the necessities of his
actual condition.</p>

<p>How the poor man felt under his disappointment,
may perhaps be better imagined than described.
It is probable, however, that he began
to have some suspicion that there was some
truth in the proverb which says, “Honesty is
the best policy.”</p>

</div>

<p>The day after the funeral all parties concerned,
except Markham, took their departure
from Brigland. The Earl’s presence was absolutely
necessary at Trimmerstone to inspect
and direct the repairs at the hall. He took
leave of Markham with much stronger expressions
of regard than he had ever used before;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for he now perceived, or thought that he had
discovered, that the barrister had not been using
the arts of a legacy-hunter. Never indeed had
his lordship seen any such conduct on the part
of Markham as might lead him to conclude unfavorably
concerning him; but his lordship had
taken up the common-place notion, that because
the profession of law requires acuteness, therefore
its professors must be sharpers.</p>

<p>Signora Rivolta trusted to Markham to
manage that part of the business which related
to her family, and at the entreaty of the
Colonel returned directly to London. For it
was the constant practice of the Colonel’s lady
to yield ready obedience to her husband’s requests,
knowing that the surest and most effectual
mode of governing a blockhead is to let
him have his own way as much as possible.</p>

<p>Markham and Mr. Price then met, for the
purpose of transacting business, at the office of
the latter. It has been already hinted that
Markham had a suspicion of the foul play of the
confidential solicitor. With this suspicion on
his mind he therefore resolved to watch him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
very narrowly, and to take especial care that
now the last will was made, it should be faithfully
and properly executed. When Markham
entered the apartment destined to be the scene
of their first consultation, he could hardly believe
it possible that so plausible, plain-speaking
a man as Mr. Price could be by any means a
dishonest man, or a man of indirect practices.
There was a recollection on the mind of the barrister
of some slight emotion expressed by Mr.
Price at the reading of the will, and also at the
previous annunciation of its existence by Mr.
Denver. But these emotions might spring from
other sources than that of disappointed covetousness;
and as Markham had not any idea of the
necessities and perplexities of the solicitor, he
thought that the legacy named in Mr. Martindale’s
will was a very ample and satisfactory
bequest. He did not however lay aside his suspicions,
or relax in his vigilance of observation.</p>

<p>It was very natural that two persons who had
both been intimate acquaintances of the deceased,
and who had scarcely ever met before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
should at a meeting of this nature first enter
into a little talk concerning their departed friend.
Mr. Price commenced by saying,</p>

<p>“This is a great loss, Mr. Markham. Our
friend Mr. Martindale will be very much missed.
The people here at Brigland were very much
grieved when housekeeping was given up at
the Abbey. The poor will have long cause to
regret their benefactor.”</p>

<p>“I believe,” replied Markham, “that Mr.
Martindale was a truly benevolent man, and
will be no doubt much missed. My acquaintance
with him has been comparatively short;
but I had the highest opinion of his heart and
understanding.”</p>

<p>“It is very strange,” said Mr. Price, “that
he should have chosen that very singular mode
of life. He had the means of living in much
better style than he did. Though I must say
that the Abbey was too magnificent a building
even for his property.”</p>

<p>“Are you aware, Mr. Price, of the real value
of the late Mr. Martindale’s property?”</p>

<p>To this question Mr. Price did not give a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
speedy reply, but muttered rather indistinctly,
and said in a very slip-shod tone of voice, “Why, I
can’t say exactly, for it consists of various parts;
some in land, some on mortgage, and some in
the funds; and the price of land is now considerably
less than it was some years ago. I really
cannot venture to say; but, however, we shall
probably ascertain that in the course of our executorship.
I suppose you intend to accept the
charge… but I fear you will find it a troublesome
task. I have myself had so much to do
with executorships, that I could almost find in
my heart to decline it in the present instance;
but I have too great a respect for the memory
of my departed client.”</p>

<p>There was something in the tone of this last
speech, which led Markham to apprehend that
there might be some truth in the tale that
he had heard from Sir Andrew Featherstone.
Without therefore betraying his suspicions, he
replied carelessly,</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I may as well act with you,
for perhaps I may be the means of saving you
some trouble. I also feel a great respect for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the memory of Mr. Martindale, though my acquaintance
has been but short.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” continued Mr. Price,
“every body who knew Mr. Martindale must
respect him. He was a man of very great kindness
of heart, and of real benevolence of disposition.”</p>

<p>The confidential solicitor then hesitated and
almost smiled, and put on one of those silly
looks which people assume when they are about
to ask what may perhaps be denied them. At
last he said,</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be desirable to settle the
business with the legatees as soon as possible.
I always prefer despatch in matters of this kind.
I think it does not look well to protract this sort
of business.”</p>

<p>“Of course it does not,” replied Markham,
“and I shall be most happy to afford you all
the assistance in my power for the furtherance
of your plans of despatch.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I thank you,” was Mr. Price’s answer;
but his manner still manifested that something
more remained to be said. Markham perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it, but most provokingly abstained from saying
any thing which might tend to assist the confidential
solicitor in the unfolding of his ideas,
or the development of his schemes.</p>

<p>After a little more hesitation, Mr. Price
proceeded: “There will perhaps be some little
trouble and delay in arranging all the affairs;
and I am afraid, Mr. Markham, that your
legacy will be paid last.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” replied Markham, “that is
as it should be; indeed I had no reason to expect
any legacy at all.”</p>

<p>“I think,” continued Mr. Price, “that you
will find your legacy rather larger than you are
now aware of; and notwithstanding all that was
said by Mr. Denver, I should have no objection
to change legacies with you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr. Price! Why surely you do
not mean to say that my legacy is worth as
much as twenty thousand pounds?”</p>

<p>Mr. Price looked very knowing and important,
and said, “Now, Mr. Markham, I will
deal candidly with you; I know that your
share will amount to more than twenty thousand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
If therefore you wish to get rid of all
trouble, and quietly receive a handsome commutation,
I can venture to say that I will give
you thirty thousand pounds for your legacy,
and I will take all the trouble of the business
on my own hands.”</p>

<p>How far Markham was truly honest and
conscientiously veracious in professing to be
surprised at this development, we will leave
casuists to determine. In order, however, to
ascertain, as readily and distinctly as he could,
the truth of the story told by Sir Andrew, he
professed great astonishment, but declined the
proffered commutation, saying with a smile,</p>

<p>“No, no, Mr. Price, I shall not let you off
so easily as that; I must have a more tempting
offer. You have said that you cannot exactly
tell how much our late friend’s property amounts
to: now, unless you had reason to suppose you
should make a very good bargain indeed, you
would not proffer so large a sum on a contingency.
Come now, confess, do you not think
that my legacy is really worth a great deal
more than thirty thousand pounds? You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
not know the precise amount of Mr. Martindale’s
property, but you cannot have had the
management of it so many years without being
able to form a tolerably correct judgment of it.
You must know the value of his mortgages, and
the amount of his funded property.”</p>

<p>Then looking more seriously, Markham went
on: “Now tell me honestly, Mr. Price, is not
the legacy in question really worth as much as
one hundred thousand pounds? I know it is,”
continued the barrister, conscious from the
solicitor’s manner that Sir Andrew Featherstone’s
story was not without foundation.</p>

<p>It then became necessary for Mr. Price to
change his tone, and to look serious. “I will
tell you honestly,” said he, “that your legacy
is worth nearer two than one hundred thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p>“But how is it that Mr. Martindale should
have assigned to you the sum of twenty thousand
pounds, as being more beneficial to you
than this enormous residue? Was our friend
so ignorant of the extent of his property as to
make so great a mistake as this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Price was confounded: he was fairly
detected; and very unpleasant indeed was it
for him to stand thus convicted before another
man of the law. The confidential solicitor was
silenced for a moment or two; and when he
recovered the power of speech, he did not so
soon recover the power of clearly expressing
himself; and if he had said, as twenty thousand
Irishmen have been twenty thousand times accused
of saying, “I am speechless,” he would
not have been far from the truth.</p>

<p>A very fine opportunity was now presented
to Markham of making a fine set speech, full
of indignation and metaphors, after the manner
of a sermon, or the last speech of the first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth acts of a new
comedy; but for many reasons he abstained.
In the first place he was not partial to spouting,
nor very dexterous in the management, or fertile
in the invention of metaphors. In the second
place, he knew that it would do no good, but
rather harm; for if the heart of Mr. Price was
not absolutely callous, the very fact of detection
and disappointment would be quite sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
make him feel, and to urge him to repent, if he
were capable of penitence. All prating and
prosing upon the subject would only have
diverted his thoughts from the meanness of
his own conduct to the quizzicality of the
spouter. Markham merely said,</p>

<p>“Do you call that conduct honest, Mr.
Price?”</p>

<p>The confidential solicitor turned away his
face; but whether it were to conceal a rising
blush or a falling tear, we cannot say: if however
it were so, we think it a great pity that he
should have concealed so great a curiosity as a
blush or a tear on the cheek of an attorney.</p>

<p>Markham then said, “Well, sir, as matters
now stand, it is impossible for me to avail
myself of this error. I must inform Mr.
Martindale’s relatives of the mistake, for it
clearly is a mistake. This instrument does not
express my late friend’s will.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” interrupted Mr. Price, “you
will not think of exposing and betraying me?”</p>

<p>“I shall certainly not accuse you, sir; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
if facts expose you, you have only yourself to
thank for the exposure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Price was angry, as most people are
when they are mortified; and he said, “Well,
Mr. Markham, you must do as you please, but
I think you excessively scrupulous.”</p>

<p>“Better so,” replied the barrister, “than
the reverse.”</p>

<p>That reply was displeasing to the solicitor,
and he rejoined, “Why, now, you cannot suppose
that either Lord Trimmerstone or Signora
Rivolta will take the property, if you offer it to
them; and then the conclusion of the matter
will be, that you will merely make a show of
magnanimous integrity and disinterestedness,
and come into a handsome fortune; so you will
get rich at my expense, and your character will
be raised by the depression of mine. Such
conduct is mean and trumpery.”</p>

<p>“Let me request of you, sir,” replied Markham,
“to confine your remarks within the
bounds of temperance and good breeding, or
you may tempt me to use the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
which you afford me of making such replies as
may not be most agreeable to you. I cannot
and will not take advantage of what I consider
to be another’s wrong.”</p>

<p>Before Markham left Mr. Price, he was
careful to take immediate steps towards putting
the business in a proper train, to have the
matter settled as soon as possible. The barrister
then called on Mr. Denver to thank him
for his attentions to the deceased. Scarcely
was Markham seated when a note was brought
to him from Mr. Price; in which note that
gentleman expressed a wish to decline acting
as executor. The note also intimated, with
many circuitous, but intelligible phrases, that it
would be exceedingly agreeable to have his
legacy paid as soon as possible; and offers
were made of all necessary assistance on the
part of the late confidential attorney.</p>

<p>To make short work of Mr. Price, we may
as well here inform our readers, that in a short
time his legacy was paid to him, and the town
of Brigland had a vacancy for a new solicitor.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Great was the astonishment of the Earl of
Trimmerstone at receiving the following letter
from Horatio Markham:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="indent">“My lord,</p>

<p>“In looking over the will of your lordship’s
late lamented relative, I am greatly concerned
to find an error which seriously affects myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Not to keep you in suspense, I have to inform
your lordship that the legacy which devolves to
me as residuary-legatee is far beyond the intention
or apprehension of the devisor. It is very
clear, that from neglecting to investigate his
affairs, the late Mr. Martindale was by no
means aware of the extent of his property.
The legacies, therefore, devised to your lordship
and others related to the deceased, are
much less than otherwise they would have been.
I know for a certainty that the will was
formed on a misapprehension. The appearance
of my name at all was by me unsought and
unexpected, and for many reasons undesirable.
Had the late Mr. Martindale bequeathed to me
a small complimentary legacy, I should have
accepted it, unhesitatingly, as a memento of
his kind friendship. Had a definite, though
unreasonably large legacy been devised to me,
I might perhaps have hesitated and refused to
accept it. But now I find that nearly one-half
of the large property possessed by the late Mr.
Martindale is bequeathed to me by an error;
and therefore I must positively, though respectfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
decline accepting more than the devisor
apprehended he had bequeathed to me.</p>

<p>“I have written on the same subject, and to
the same purpose, to Signora Rivolta; and I
wait to know hers and your lordship’s will and
pleasure concerning the matter in question.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to be, &amp;c.”</p>

</div>

<p>When the above letter arrived at Trimmerstone,
his lordship was busily engaged in inspecting
the progress of the operatives at the
old hall.</p>

<p>Part of the building had been promptly made
fit for his lordship’s residence; and as his establishment
was now very small, he was not
reluctant to use the contracted residence
assigned to him. We have already intimated
that the Earl of Trimmerstone was depressed
in spirits: it is indeed very natural that he
should be. The life which he had led, the
companions with whom he had associated, the
disappointments which he had experienced, his
foolish marriage, the disgraceful conduct of his
silly countess, the taunts and reproaches of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
opulent relative, the weariness and disgust that
he felt in having nothing to do, and the annoyance
of an empty title, which merely mocked
him with the epithet of Right Honorable, all
these things combined to render him almost
disgusted with, and weary of life.</p>

<p>In this humor he went to Trimmerstone, and
took up his abode at the miserable old hall.
The gloom of the building was quite in unison
with the feelings of his mind, and he very contentedly
set himself down to lament over the
vanity of life, and to make amends for his past
transgressions by growling right surlily at the
sins of others. His solitude was soon invaded
by a visit from the rector of Trimmerstone, who
was rather fanatical in his theology, and finical
in attire and address. Neither of these qualities
were, in the first instance, agreeable to his
lordship; but the Rev. Marmaduke Sprout
had the capacity for flattery in a very high
degree. He could presently render himself
agreeable to any person of exalted rank by his
very courteous and conciliating demeanour; and
he possessed a peculiar softness and gentleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of manner, with which indeed the Earl of Trimmerstone
would, in his past days of cock-fighting,
horse-racing, and boxing, have been thoroughly
disgusted. But his lordship was quite an altered
man. He did not exactly know what was the
matter with himself, till Mr. Sprout introduced to
his fretful and fidgetty lordship the subject of
fanaticism. That became an excellent antistagnator,
and set all his fancies and vagaries at
work in quite an opposite direction to that which
they had hitherto taken. Formerly, the lowest
pursuits under the name of sport or fancy had
been agreeable to his lordship; and every species
of religious sentiment he had regarded with
the profoundest contempt and the most unmingled
abhorrence. But now he was sick, and
weary of all these things; and because one
extreme was purely offensive and wearisome, he
took it for granted that the opposite must be
truly delightful and highly consistent, and so
under the tuition of Mr. Sprout, he changed
and reversed all his habits, good, bad, and indifferent.
From staking thousands at a horse-race,
he turned up his eyes at the grievous abomination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of half-crown whist; and, indeed, had
he been disposed to card-playing, he could not
have indulged himself at Trimmerstone, for Mr.
Sprout had banished almost all card-playing
from the place, so that there was not a pack of
cards in the parish, except two or three mutilated
well-thumbed packs of quadrille-cards,
which were still used by a knot of antiquated
spinsters worthy of the good old days of Sacheverel
and High Church. Quadrille-cards will not
do for whist, for all the eights, nines and tens are
thrown out. Formerly, Lord Trimmerstone used
to be proud of giving some of his acquaintance
a sumptuous dinner; but now he had changed
all that, and he only kept one female cook, who
could just manage to make a comfortable and
snug little dish or two for his lordship’s own self,
occasionally assisted by the Rev. Mr. Sprout.
Formerly, his lordship had been disposed to be
lively, and oftentimes facetious; but now he was
prodigiously grave, and almost sulky. Formerly,
his lordship never went to church; now he went
twice every Sunday, and said Amen as loud as
the clerk, and with much more solemnity, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
clerk did not turn up his eyes for fear of losing
the place. Formerly, his lordship had been very
candid; now he had become exceedingly censorious,
and he seemed to measure his religion
by the severity with which he reproved transgressors.
His lordship several times attempted to
make all the inhabitants of Trimmerstone go to
church twice every Sunday, except his own cook.
But in this his lordship could not succeed, and
indeed it was well for him that he could not;
for if he had, the church would have been so
crowded that he could not have enjoyed a great,
large, lined, stuffed, padded, carpeted pew for
himself.</p>

<p>Though Lord Trimmerstone was a zealous
convert to Mr. Sprout’s theory of the national
religion, yet that theory was not quite obvious
and distinct to his lordship’s apprehension; and
often did he blunder in the enunciation of his
theory, and awkwardly did he sometimes express
himself when he thought he was contending for
the truth: for he has been known to rebuke
the unepiscopal worshippers in barns and outhouses
for holding the pestilential doctrines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
election and predestination. This was pardonable
in a young beginner; but Mr. Sprout set him
right, and showed that the doctrines of predestination
and election had been sometimes erroneously
apprehended to mean predestination and
election, whereas the proper view of the subject
was that they meant election and predestination.</p>

<p>That part of fanaticism which consists in
gloominess and moroseness, his lordship could
manage to admiration; for he was thoroughly
disgusted with every thing and every body. We
cannot resist the inclination to observe in this
part of our narrative, how very just and appropriate
a punishment is fanaticism for gross immorality.
When the mind has spurned the
meeker and gentler bonds of religious principle
and conscientious thought, it is rightly punished
by the withering rigors of fanaticism, and the
gloomy terrors of superstition. Under these influences
was now lying the Earl of Trimmerstone.
And he was engaged in conversation with the
Rev. Marmaduke Sprout, when there was delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
into his lordship’s hands the above-mentioned
letter of Horatio Markham.</p>

<p>His lordship made the apology usual on such
occasions, and forthwith opened and read Markham’s
letter. As soon as the reading was
finished, his lordship said, “This is very honorable
conduct in Mr. Markham.”</p>

<p>Then handing the letter to Mr. Sprout, he
said, “Read this letter, sir, and let me have
your advice, how I ought to act under present
circumstances.”</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman took the letter bowing,
and perused it with great attention, and returned
to his lordship with another bow, and a
smile of satisfaction at being let into a great
man’s confidence; and said,</p>

<p>“Really, my lord, I hardly know how to advise.
Cases do sometimes occur in which there
is a great deal of difficulty, and this appears to
me to be one of them.”</p>

<p>By this speech, though delivered with the
solemnity of an oracle, very little information
was communicated to his lordship. When people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
ask for advice, they should, in order to save
their friends a great deal of trouble, state explicitly
what sort of advice they wish to have.
It is for want of this honesty and explicitness
that so much good advice is continually thrown
away.</p>

<p>His lordship was now fairly puzzled and perplexed.
It was necessary to send some answer
to the communication of Markham; and his
lordship had discernment enough to perceive that
this gentleman was truly a scrupulous and conscientious
man. The present transaction proved
that fact abundantly. For nine hundred and
ninety-nine persons out of a thousand would,
without much if any hesitation, have accepted
the legacy in question. That feeling in Markham,
to which some persons might be inclined to
give the name of moral prudery, prevented him
from availing himself of a decided error; and
on the other hand, his dislike of ostentatious
magnanimity and heroics placed him in an unpleasant
situation in making an offer of surrendering
the legacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the various lectures and the
great and clear information which Mr. Sprout
had communicated to Lord Trimmerstone, concerning
those views of religion most suitable to
fanaticism, his lordship was but imperfectly initiated:
therefore, when he had read Markham’s
letter, and handed it over to Mr. Sprout
for his perusal also, his lordship could not help
observing,</p>

<p>“This is really very meritorious conduct in
Mr. Markham, there is not one man in a
thousand who would have acted thus under
these circumstances.”</p>

<p>To this Mr. Sprout very seriously and solemnly
replied, “Your lordship will excuse
me, but I must observe that there is nothing
meritorious in human actions.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sprout,” said his lordship, “I will not
contend with you for a word; but you must
grant, that notwithstanding the supreme importance
of faith, which I am quite ready to allow,
there is a great difference in human actions, and
that some conduct is better than other. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
are multitudes who have not faith who frequently
perform virtuous actions, and live according
to the principles of morality.”</p>

<p>The clergyman shook his head, and said,
“Mere heathen morality.”</p>

<p>“And that,” replied Lord Trimmerstone, “is
better than no morality at all.”</p>

<p>It could not be entertaining to our readers to
pursue the long and elaborate arguments by
which the rector of Trimmerstone attempted to
prove that virtue was of no value but of great
importance. We therefore proceed with our
narrative.</p>

<p>When the discussion was concluded, and his
lordship was abundantly convinced that he knew
nothing about the matter, he directed his
thoughts to the subject of Markham’s letter:
and as the divine had given all the advice
upon the business which he was able to give,
he took his leave; and the Earl of Trimmerstone
remained alone to consult with his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>All that his lordship could think was, that
this conduct of Markham was very handsome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
But that was not enough. It would not be a
very satisfactory answer to Markham should his
lordship say merely that such conduct was very
handsome. After much deliberation, his lordship
came to the conclusion, that it would be best to
have an interview with Markham on the subject,
and to make inquiry into all the particulars,
resolving to compel the barrister to the acceptance
of as much as he could force upon him.</p>

<p>With this view his lordship sent to Markham
an immediate acknowledgment of the receipt
of his communication, proposing at the
same time a meeting with him for the purpose
of entering into the particulars of the affair; for
Markham’s letter had not sufficiently to his lordship’s
apprehension explained the cause and nature
of the error in the will.</p>

<p>Markham’s letter to Signora Rivolta received
also an immediate answer, and that answer was
decisive. The lady, after complimenting the
barrister for his very honorable conduct, said, that
it was quite out of the question that she or her
family could have, according to the laws of England,
any claim whatever on any part of the property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
save that which was literally and expressly
bequeathed to them; and that if any remained
unappropriated or unclaimed, the only
person who had aught to do with it must of
course be the heir-at-law.</p>

<p>Thus it seemed that the business was brought
into a small compass, resting only between
Markham and Lord Trimmerstone. And though
his lordship’s moral susceptibility might not have
been quite so acute and delicate as Markham’s,
yet when such an appeal as this was made to
his feelings, he could not but entertain some
thoughts of disinterestedness: for the disinterestedness
of the residuary-legatee was so
powerful, as to excite in his lordship’s mind a
degree of sympathy and a corresponding feeling.</p>

<div class="verse">“He could not do it handsomer than thus.”</div>
<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Shirley.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An arrangement was made that Lord Trimmerstone
should meet the residuary-legatee at
Brigland, at the house and in the presence of
Mr. Denver, whose testimony on the subject
was of so much consequence in settling the point
in question. For on the face of the matter,
Markham was clearly and unequivocally entitled
to the residue of the late Mr. Martindale’s
property, after payment of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
legacies named in the will; but from what
the devisor just before his decease had said to Mr.
Denver, it appeared that he was not conscious
that the bequest appropriated to Markham was
any thing near so valuable as by the acknowledgment
of Mr. Price it turned out to be.</p>

<p>The perplexity occasioned by wills is not often
of such a nature as that now recorded. It is
indeed refreshing to the moral eye to contemplate
such an instance of sound and healthy
moral feeling. Markham was not so inexperienced
as to be ignorant of the value of money,
or so romantic and visionary as to despise opulence;
but had sense enough to know, and had
been observant enough to see, that money does
not command every thing, and that it may be
purchased at too high a price.</p>

<p>When Markham had received Lord Trimmerstone’s
note, he immediately called on Mr.
Denver to inform him of the intention of the
meeting, and to request that he would have the
goodness to let his lordship know precisely, or
as distinctly as he could recollect, all that Mr.
Martindale had said to him concerning his motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in altering the will. The clergyman expressed
much astonishment at this proposed
meeting, and said,</p>

<p>“What! does my Lord Trimmerstone intend
to dispute the will? I am very positive that it is
really and truly the actual will of the late Mr.
Martindale; and I can very distinctly recollect
all that the old gentlemen said.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Denver,” replied Markham, “his
lordship has not expressed any such intention;
but there appears to have been some misapprehension
in the mind of our late friend as to the
actual amount of his property, and what we
wish to ascertain from you is, whether Mr.
Martindale in bequeathing twenty thousand
pounds to Mr. Price, did not imagine that he
was giving him more than would have come to
him as a residuary-legatee.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mr. Denver, “that was
what Mr. Martindale said in my hearing. He
also said, that another reason for altering his
will was that he might put your name into it;
and I am very glad to hear that your legacy is
so much more than you expected. I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that Mr. Price feels himself very much disappointed.”</p>

<p>With a slight frown and a look of thoughtfulness,
Markham replied, “I am not so well
pleased as you may imagine with the unexpected
greatness of this legacy, it puts me into
a very awkward position. I can by no means
think of taking more than Mr. Martindale intended
to give me, and it is very unpleasant to
appear in the light of conferring an obligation
on Lord Trimmerstone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Denver expanded his countenance into a
broad look of astonishment, and said, “Bless
me, Mr. Markham, why how very scrupulous
you are! I cannot see how any body can blame
you for taking the legacy. It was not your
doing that Mr. Martindale was ignorant of the
full value of his property. Though between
ourselves, and I hope you will not let it go any
farther, I dare say that Mr. Price used no
little pains to keep Mr. Martindale in the dark
with a view of coming into a handsome fortune
as residuary-legatee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“And would you have me, Mr. Denver, to
take an advantage of another’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“I cannot see,” replied the clergyman,
“why you should not: you are not injuring
any one. Lord Trimmerstone has quite as
much as he expected, and I dare say that he
will not desire to deprive you of any part of
what falls to your lot.”</p>

<p>Not even the authority of the divine could
convince Markham that he should be acting
rightly in availing himself of the bequest to its
full extent; and there was also in his mind
another objection&mdash;he was ambitious, as we
have before observed, of high reputation; and it
would have interfered greatly with his comfort
and happiness, had he thought that any persons
who at all knew him, had the slightest suspicion
that there was any thing in his character that
savored of meanness or littleness; nor would he
have been pleased to have owed his good fortune
merely to accident. These feelings may be fastidious,
but they have their use; and though they
may not exist very widely, or influence the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of many individuals, yet they have a power in
society, and are useful in keeping up the standard
of morals and integrity. If it were not
for an occasional example of individuals rising
above the ordinary level, the influence of the
multitude beneath it would gradually but surely
sink the standard, and lead to serious deterioration.</p>

<p>According to appointment, Lord Trimmerstone,
a few days after, came to Brigland, for
the purpose of discussing with Markham the
perplexities of the will. The meeting took
place at the house and in the presence of Mr.
Denver. When his lordship entered the room
he held out his hand with great cordiality to
Markham, and did not at all seem to feel his
dignity abated by familiarity of address to one
of whose understanding and moral worth he
had the very highest opinion. So much good
had fanaticism done to his lordship, as to render
him less haughty in his outward demeanour,
and to prompt to at least the semblance of
courtesy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markham,” said the Earl, “I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
received a letter from you which has very
much surprised me. Do I understand it
aright?”</p>

<p>“The letter, my lord, which I sent to you,
was simply to inform you that on looking into
the affairs of your lordship’s late relative, Mr.
John Martindale, I find, to my great astonishment,
that his property far exceeds what by his
will seemed his own apprehension of the extent
of it; and therefore that the legacy which
devolves to me as residuary-legatee, is much
greater than the devisor apprehended or designed.
Under these circumstances, therefore,
I wrote to your lordship, as one of the nearest
relatives of the deceased, to know what might
be your will as to the disposal of the property.”</p>

<p>His lordship smiled and said, “My will, Mr.
Markham, is, that you should take possession
of whatever my cousin has bequeathed to you.
For if your legacy had turned out to be less than
you expected, I dare say that you would not
have applied to me to increase it; and now that
it happens to be more, why should I consent to
diminish it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Had it been a little more or a little less,
my lord, it would have been superfluous to take
notice of it; but when I know that it was Mr.
Martindale’s intention to leave me only ten or
fifteen thousand pounds, I cannot with any
propriety avail myself of an absolute error
which puts me in possession of a very large
fortune. By this error, I am placed in a very
unpleasant situation.”</p>

<p>“But how are you sure, Mr. Markham, that
this is an error? I see pretty well how the
case stands. You have not sent for Mr. Price
to meet us on this occasion: you had compassion
on his feelings. I have long suspected that
this man has not been acting quite honestly
towards my late relative. I know that he expected
to be residuary-legatee; and he has
concealed, or at least endeavoured to conceal,
from Mr. Martindale the real extent of his
property: but you must have known that my
cousin was a shrewd observant man; and is it
not possible that having detected the trickery
of this confidential gentleman, he may have
resolved thus to disappoint him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can hardly admit that, my lord,” replied
Markham; “for Mr. Denver has told me that
when this last will was made, Mr. Martindale
expressed himself desirous of leaving to Mr.
Price something more than would devolve to
him as residuary-legatee; and I can hardly suppose
that Mr. Martindale would have left him
any thing at all had he detected him in such a
transaction. I thank you, my lord, for the construction
which you are liberally disposed to
put on the will; but I cannot indeed, and I
will not avail myself of what I consider as an
absolute error.”</p>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone listened seriously, looked
thoughtfully, and at last, after a considerable
pause, said, “Well, Mr. Markham, if it must
be so it must; but I sincerely tell you, I am
sorry that you are so scrupulous. You really
put me into an unpleasant situation; for if it be
not honorable for you to accept the property, I
cannot think that I should be acting honorably
in availing myself of your generosity.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” continued Markham, “you must
not call it generosity. I am acting upon what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
I conceive to be a principle of simple justice.
I might of course take advantage lawfully of
the error; but law and justice so far differ, inasmuch
as justice must depend upon circumstances;
and the letter of a written law cannot
change according to varying events and unforeseen
accidents.”</p>

<p>This was all very true and very proper.
Lord Trimmerstone could not but admire and
commend Markham’s spirit. On the other
hand, Markham was astonished at the apparent
change in Lord Trimmerstone’s manners, which
were not as they had been, those of a proud
and vulgar man of high rank, but civil, gentle,
and courteous. The fanatic principle had really
done his lordship some good. Nothing short
of that could have checked him in his gambling
course, or brought him from the society of his
reckless and heedless companions. It is true
that there was not a very complete, nor, in all
respects, an entirely advantageous change in his
manners. He had become somewhat morose
and cynical; and from being delighted with
excesses, he had become snarlingly disgusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
at temperate pleasures; and he looked with a
kind of moral contempt upon those characters
which had stood, in a moral point of view, much
higher than his own. But at all events, to get
rid of ruinous and profligate habits is desirable,
and worth some sacrifices.</p>

<p>The interview between Markham and the
Earl of Trimmerstone terminated in the conclusion,
that the former should take as his
legacy a sum equal to that which was devised
to Mr. Price; and that the Earl of Trimmerstone
should appropriate, according to his own
will and pleasure as heir-at-law, that part of
the property which Markham contended had
not been, morally speaking, devised to any one.</p>

<p>It is not designed that our readers should
imagine that the Earl of Trimmerstone readily
and easily consented to the above-named arrangements;
but it is thought unnecessary to
narrate at greater length the dialogue which
took place between the parties on the subject.
Every well-constituted and healthy mind will
naturally and easily suppose what arguments
Markham used, and by what objections they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
were met on the part of his lordship; and those
who cannot imagine what was said would not
understand, enjoy, or believe it, were it written
out for them fully and literally.</p>

<p>Markham triumphed, or gained his point by
virtue of possessing the strongest and best
exercised mind of the two; but it was not
without great reluctance that Lord Trimmerstone
consented to regard that large residue of
his late relative’s property as being undisposed
of by the will: for his lordship had never been
a mean or selfish man in the days of his profligacy
and libertinism; and now that he had
altogether changed his manner of life, and had
seriously and soberly set about a reformation of
his manners, and was amply supplied by his
late relative’s bequest with all the means which
he could desire, he really did feel anxious to
perform an act of generosity, and would willingly,
for the sake of the reputation of the
action, have surrendered the property in question
to Markham, even had there been any
doubt as to the legal accuracy of the bequest.</p>

<p>It was therefore a matter of concern to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that he had not been able to prevail on the
barrister to take quietly the bequest which was
his by law. The feeling of generosity was also
strongly excited in his mind by means of sympathy
with Markham. There was something
so accurately and purely honorable in Markham’s
conduct on this occasion, that the force
of it was irresistible; and a much less liberal
mind than that of Lord Trimmerstone could
not deliberately, coolly, and selfishly, have
taken advantage of it. Nor was it till Markham
had represented how much his mind was
oppressed by the reflections which he anticipated
would be cast on him by the world, that
Lord Trimmerstone would consent to have
any thing whatever to do with it. When, however,
Markham made his lordship understand
that the favor was conferred by him who
received, and not by him who surrendered the
doubtful bequest, then did he accept the disposal
of the property in question.</p>

</div>

<p>It now became necessary for Markham to
return to London; but he forgot not, in his
way thither, to pay his dutiful respects to his
parents. It is true that he had been placed in
a very unpleasant situation, by the unexpectedly
large bequest of the late Mr. Martindale; so
that, however pleased he might be with an
opportunity afforded him of being serviceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to his father, there was an alloy in that pleasure
by means of the error in the will, or rather
the misapprehension of the devisor. So mingled
is the complexion of life’s events, that our
brightest days are not cloudless, and our
darkest nights are not without some glimmering
of a friendly star; and surely we may be
content to have our joys a little abated, when
by the same token we may anticipate that our
sorrows will be somewhat alleviated.</p>

<p>After the interview which Markham had
had with the Earl of Trimmerstone he felt his
mind lightened of burden, and his spirits were
greatly revived. And, considering that he
wore the habiliments of sorrow, he carried on
his countenance the aspect and look of much
cheerfulness and composure of mind: for he
was happy in the consciousness of having done
that which he knew and felt to be right.</p>

<p>For Markham’s sake and our own we must
be allowed a short digression on the subject of
bright faces and black suits. It is a piece of
arrant foolery, and detestably silly cant, to
make a sneering prating about the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in which people bear or feel the loss of their
friends or relatives. Sorrow is not to be
measured by everlasting length of face: any
one may assume dull, cold, melancholy looks,
and heave sighs with every passing minute;
but they who most regret the departed have
oftentimes brighter and gayer looks than those
who think they ought to be sorry, but feel that
they are not. Markham regretted the loss of
a good friend, of a cheerful companion, of a
kind patron, and good adviser; but Markham
had reason, good reason, to be pleased and
satisfied with himself, that he had got rid of
what might be a reproach, and that he possessed
the means of saving his venerated and
respected parents from the calamity of an old
age of poverty and privation.</p>

<p>He spent a very short time with his father
and mother, and then hastened to town to give
immediate attention to his professional duties,
and to his business as executor.</p>

<p>The intelligence of what was called his good
fortune reached town long before him. Many
and ridiculous were the rumors concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the immense property which had devolved to
him. So outrageous and unfounded were the
tales told of his wealth, that had he been
disposed to say it, he might have persuaded
not a few that his riches were equal to or
beyond the largest known property in the
kingdom. At his chambers he found a myriad
of cards. The little card-racks which Miss
Henderson had painted for him were choked
even to suffocation. Cards were on his chimney-piece,
and cards were lying on his table.
There also appeared a goodly host of prospectuses
and syllabuses and proposals; and
specimens and schemes; and catalogues and
first numbers of new periodicals, and shop-bills,
and addresses to the public, and cases of
distress; and plans of estates, and notices of
sale, and recommendatory letters and applications
for places; and letters from coachmen,
footmen, butlers, stable-boys, postilions, cooks,
housemaids, housekeepers, kitchen-maids, valets,
and a multitude of others too numerous
to mention. There was a whole week’s work
before him to read them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>At sight of all this he sighed, stared,
shaked his head and smiled; and he thought to
himself, that it was a very good thing that he
was not prime minister, for then he should be
pestered with myriads more applications, and
with matters not so easy to be disposed of.</p>

<p>His card-rack was a complete memorandum-book,
for there he read the names of every
individual whom he had ever seen or spoken
to, and besides them a great many more.
What could be more natural than for Mr.
Jackson to say to Dr. Smith, “I am going to
call on Markham?” And what could be more
natural than for Dr. Smith to say, “I will go
with you, and you may introduce me?” So
then Markham’s friend, Jackson, leaves his
card, and Jackson’s friend, Dr. Smith, leaves
his card too.</p>

<p>Markham had never been of a covetous
disposition; but now he felt most especially
and peculiarly delighted, that there was no
foundation for the intemperate and extravagant
reports concerning his immense wealth.</p>

<p>A paradoxical friend of ours, who makes it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
rule to believe every thing that all the world disbelieves,
and to disbelieve all that the rest of the
world believes, has started an ingenious theory
concerning the “<em>fortunate youth</em>,” who made
such a noise some years ago. It is our friend’s
theory, that the story of his immense wealth was
perfectly true, but that he found so much trouble
in the disposal of it, and was annoyed by and
threatened with such a host of applications, dependents,
and acquaintances, that to get rid of
all trouble he destroyed all the documents of
his wealth, and sunk back for the sake of ease
and quiet into his original insignificance and
obscurity.</p>

<p>There is some plausibility in this theory; and
it must be acknowledged that such was Markham’s
state of mind at those symptoms of botheration
which he saw in his chambers, in his card-racks,
and on his table, that it would not have
been much to be wondered at, if, on the supposition
that his wealth was really so great as it
was reported to be, he had adopted the same plan
to get rid of his annoyances.</p>

<p>Knowing, however, that so great a weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
responsibility did not rest upon him, he perused
and glanced over these solicitations of attention
with a much more calm and composed mind. Very
few of them appeared to him deserving of notice;
and as far as concerned the callers, whose cards
adorned his racks, there were not above five per
cent that needed any return. With respect to
some of them he thought, rather humorously
indeed, that it might be advisable to send them
back to their owners accompanied with an affidavit
sworn before the Lord Mayor, that Horatio
Markham’s legacy did not exceed twenty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>There was one place, however, where he resolved
to pay his immediate respects, and for
which no hint of card-leaving was necessary.
This call was of course on the daughter of the
late Mr. Martindale. Under present circumstances,
such call was absolutely necessary; it
was also to himself highly and truly agreeable.
He had not forgotten, nor could he well forget
Clara Rivolta. He was quite uncertain what
place he now held in her esteem; he knew not
what might be the effect of attempting to renew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the acquaintance; and Markham was quite as
delicate and fastidious in affairs of the heart as
in affairs of the purse. He recollected also the
stern-looking Father Martini, and he thought of
the force of bigotry and fanaticism, and of the
power which superstition has over many minds
otherwise intelligent, rational, and amiable.
There was in his mind also the thought that so
far as pecuniary matters were concerned, there
was not now that objection which formerly there
had been; and he thought also that Dr. Crack
had taken Miss Henderson away from amongst
the obstacles, and that Mr. Tippetson had very
effectually disposed of himself: there remained
therefore but one impediment, but that one
might be insuperable.</p>

<p>Markham found the mother and daughter together
as usual. But notwithstanding his previous
determination to observe as accurately and attentively
as possible the looks and manners of Clara
and her mother, so as to draw some decisive inferences
from them, he found himself too deeply
interested and too much agitated to make any
thing like a satisfactory observation. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
ladies had of course heard something of the rumors
which were so loudly and widely circulated
respecting Markham’s good fortune; but
they were not by any means aware of the extent
of Mr. Martindale’s property; he might for
aught they knew have left behind him fifty
times the amount attributed to him. They would
not, however, and could not believe the dirty insinuations
that Markham had endeavoured, and
but too successfully, to induce the old gentleman
to bequeath to him an unreasonable and enormous
share of his wealth.</p>

<p>Signora Rivolta knew, or fancied she knew,
Markham’s character too well to imagine it possible
that he should have been guilty of any thing
like meanness. In the language also of the
letter which he had written to her on examining
into the affairs of the deceased, there was obviously
a strong and clear feeling of sincerity. The
daughter of the late Mr. Martindale therefore
received the executor and residuary-legatee with
great cordiality, and the manners of confidence
and friendship.</p>

<p>Markham was so far in self-possession as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
see that he was not a totally unwelcome visitor.
This discovery gave him some little confidence;
but it was possible, and he thought of that possibility,
that all suspicion of his designs towards
Clara had vanished from the mind of Signora
Rivolta. He began to speak about the departed,
to state the nature of the property which he had
left behind him. Signora Rivolta listened, more
as a matter of duty than of interest or curiosity.
Markham explained that some months must
elapse before the property could be appropriated
according to the will of the testator.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markham,” said the mother of Clara,
“I am perfectly well satisfied that the business
is placed in very proper hands, and I thank you
for the trouble which you are taking. I hope,
too, that my Lord Trimmerstone has not suffered
you to give way to that romantic generosity
which you spoke of in your letter to me.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, madam,” replied Markham, “I
do not consider that there was any thing romantic
or even generous in the surrender to which
you refer. I am desirous of preserving on my
mind the recollection of my late worthy friend;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and I could not dwell with satisfaction on this
recollection, if I were sensible of having taken an
advantage of an error to withhold from his family
what of right belongs to them.”</p>

<p>“Such feelings are an honor to you, sir; but
I cannot think that the Earl of Trimmerstone
will take advantage of your scrupulous feelings.
I know very little of his lordship, but I do not
think him capable of such a want of generosity.”</p>

<p>“The Earl of Trimmerstone,” replied Markham,
“is by no means deficient in generosity;
that was never his character. But I am happy
to say that I have been able to convince and
persuade his lordship of the propriety of his
taking upon himself the disposal of that property,
which I consider, and which every honest
man would consider, as unappropriated by its late
possessor.”</p>

<p>The daughter of the late John Martindale
was not slow in apprehending the feeling of
Horatio Markham; and it was pleasant to
Clara to hear such conversation between the
barrister and her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>This conversation was presently interrupted
by the entrance of that frightful-looking priest,
whose inquisitor-like visage had so horrified
Markham a short time before. The young
man would have retired, but Signora Rivolta
desired him to stay, and forthwith she introduced
him by name to the dreaded priest. And when
Father Martini spoke to the barrister, there
was in his voice something not altogether unpleasant.
There was solemnity and formality,
but there was also kindness and even persuasiveness;
and as Markham entered more particularly
into conversation with him, there
were in his sentiments and expressions strong
manifestations of liberal feelings and comprehensive
views. Now as Markham knew that
Father Martini was zealous for the faith and
discipline of his own church, he also supposed
that he must be grossly ignorant and illiberal.
Markham’s reasoning run thus: Father Martini
professes a religion which is absurd and
irrational; therefore Father Martini must be
an absurd and irrational man: Father Martini
professes a religion which assumes to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
only way of salvation; Father Martini, therefore,
must suppose that all the rest of the world
must be lost, and therefore he must be exceedingly
illiberal. Older men than Markham,
and men of greater pretence than he, have
used the same leaky logic, without perhaps
acknowledging it to themselves. Not frequently
is it forgotten that nine times out of ten a man’s
character has more influence on his religion
than his religion has on his character; as a
man’s shoe more frequently takes the shape of
his foot, than his foot takes the shape of his
shoe. But discussions of this nature are for
shoemakers and theologians. So we proceed
with our narrative.</p>

<p>Markham became rather pleased with the
aged priest, and was also pleased with himself
for his own liberality. The priest also was
pleased with Markham, and thought him a very
promising subject for conversion, on account of
the great candour with which he spoke of the
Catholic church, and the temperate manner in
which he discussed divers points on which, in
their interview, they happened to touch. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
logic of the priest was not indeed much better
than the logic of Markham; for candour towards
an opponent is not always a symptom of
conversion to the said opponent’s creed or
theory. There needs, in order to conversion,
a strong principle of partisanship. This our
young friend possessed not. Nevertheless, the
two happened to be well pleased with each
other; and there is some good, some religion
even, in brotherly love. There is not a great
superabundance of that article in the world;
whenever therefore it does appear, it should be
greeted well.</p>

<p>Markham, after a long conversation with
Father Martini, retired. When he was gone,
the priest observed to Signora Rivolta that he
could not think that so ingenuous a young man
could be a very obstinate heretic; but that, in
all probability, if some few of his prejudices
could be removed, he might be induced, as
being a man of good sense, to embrace the
Catholic faith. Precisely the same opinion did
Markham entertain concerning Father Martini.
It was a great pity, the barrister thought, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a man of such liberal feelings, enlightened
views, and benevolent disposition, should have
been brought up in a faith so contradictory to
common sense, and so revolting to the understanding,
and all the best feelings of the mind.
Both were thus happy in their own thoughts,
and pleased with their own theories.</p>

<p>Clara Rivolta now listened with unusual
interest and earnestness to the conversation
which passed between her mother and Father
Martini; and every moment was she in
expectation, in trembling expectation, of hearing
something said concerning the arrangement recommended,
in order to keep herself in the
steady profession of the Catholic faith. But
the conversation took a more secular turn, and
mention was made of the will of the late Mr.
Martindale.</p>

<p>Signora Rivolta was a little surprised at the
very particular and earnest manner in which
Father Martini inquired concerning the will and
its particulars.</p>

<p>“You should have inquired, father,” said
she, “when the gentleman who has just left us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
was present. He is one of the executors, and
is in possession of all the several specifications
and items of the will.”</p>

<p>“And who,” said the priest, “is inheritor of
the greater part of the property?”</p>

<p>“That,” replied the lady, “is doubtful.
From the little that I can recollect of the will,
I believe it was Mr. Martindale’s design to give
the greater part of his property to the Earl of
Trimmerstone; but, in consequence of some
error or misapprehension as to the extent and
value of the property, I understand that a very
large proportion, perhaps nearly half, devolves
to Mr. Markham as residuary-legatee.”</p>

<p>“And was he related to Mr. Martindale?”</p>

<p>“No, father,” replied Signora Rivolta;
“but an accidental acquaintance led Mr. Martindale
to think very highly of this gentleman’s
moral and intellectual qualities; and observing
his disinterestedness and good feeling in various
instances, it was the intention of my late father
to leave him a legacy; and the young gentleman
has shown a proper, and perhaps an almost
refined and fastidious feeling on the subject.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Hereupon Signora Rivolta went on to state
the particulars, of which the reader is already
in possession. Father Martini on this looked
thoughtful; and several times he was about to
speak, but he checked himself, and at last he
abruptly said, “Of what does the property
consist?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell you,” said the daughter
of the late John Martindale; “but Mr. Markham
will be here again to-morrow, and you may
learn from him all that you wish to know on
the subject.”</p>

<div class="verse">A heart and head eas’d of a weighty care.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>On the following morning the priest was
again at the house of Signora Rivolta, and met,
as he expected, with the barrister. Their
greeting on the present occasion was far more
agreeable than it had been before. They had
a mutual good opinion of each other; and the
old man could not but be pleased with the tale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
which he had heard the preceding day of the
honorable and upright conduct of Markham.
Father Martini addressed himself, after some
common-place observations, very seriously and
in set terms to the executor.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markham, I have heard from this
worthy lady of an act of justice on your part
which does you great credit:” Markham
bowed. The priest continued: “I understand
that you conscientiously have offered to surrender
the property to the heir-at-law.”</p>

<p>“I have so, sir,” replied Markham, “and
for that purpose I have had an interview with
the Earl of Trimmerstone, who is the heir-at-law;
and as soon as the business can be
arranged, the property will be delivered to
him: for I consider that, as heir-at-law, he has
a right to all that is not otherwise expressly
willed.”</p>

<p>“And can you tell me,” continued Father
Martini, “what relation the Earl of Trimmerstone
is to the late John Martindale?”</p>

<p>Before Mr. Markham could answer that
question, the conversation was interrupted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the announcement and arrival of a stranger;
and who should that stranger be, but the Right
Hon. the Earl of Trimmerstone himself! It
is not the first time in the experience of humanity
that a person, whose name has been
mentioned in conversation, has suddenly and
unexpectedly made his appearance. When his
lordship therefore entered the apartment, the
conversation concerning him ceased; and Father
Martini was under the necessity of suspending
his curiosity relative to his proximity of relationship
to the late John Martindale.</p>

<p>Signora Rivolta looked as if she expected
that the priest would take his departure on the
arrival of Lord Trimmerstone; but Father
Martini looked as if he was fully resolved to
stay and hear all that might pass. There is
something very awkward in that arrangement
of civilised society, which allows us to ask
persons to come into our houses, but does not
permit us to dismiss them when we please. In
consequence of having no regular form for this,
sometimes important, purpose, we are under
the necessity of having recourse to the roundabout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
plan of giving hints more or less broad;
and sometimes these are not understood, and
sometimes they are given so clumsily as to partake
very strongly of the nature of rudeness.
People are not invited into their neighbours’
houses merely by hints; and why should they
be sent away by mere hints?</p>

<p>Lord Trimmerstone, however, did not seem
to regard the presence of Father Martini, but
expressed himself very glad to meet with
Markham. “I have been at your chambers,
Mr. Markham,” said his lordship, “and was
directed to you here. Otherwise,” turning to
Signora Rivolta, “I should have taken the
liberty to have appointed a meeting here.”</p>

<p>The lady bowed, as signifying that such
meeting would not have been taking too great
a liberty.</p>

<p>“The business on which I have called is
concerning this perplexing affair of my late
worthy relative’s will. I am sorry to find that
our good friend here is so very scrupulous in
the matter of his legacy; but he insists upon
it that I, as heir-at-law, must have the disposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of it. The time was, madam, that I could
have spent this and as much more in folly and
vanity. I have now done with the world.
I hate it. I abhor it. I have been deceived
and disappointed. I have felt and I have seen,
and I am disgusted with its vanities. I cannot
use this property, and I will not abuse it. It
needed only a certain ceremony to have been
performed many years ago to have constituted
you heir-at-law to this property, now fastidiously
refused by our friend here. It was not
your fault that that ceremony was not performed.”</p>

<p>Father Martini stayed to some purpose: for
at this point he interrupted the speaker, saying,
with great earnestness and energy of manner,
“That ceremony was performed. I myself
performed it; and I have in my possession
proofs of it.”</p>

<p>It was very natural, at such a speech as this,
that every person in the room should start and
stare, and stand speechless for a few seconds,
and then say, “Indeed!” The effect, however,
was not quite so electric. The individual most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
concerned in the discovery seemed the least
moved of the party. The priest then went on
to state the particulars, and produce his proofs.
These proofs might have been satisfactory or
not: there was no disposition in any of the
party to question them. The documents were
slightly looked over by his lordship; who was
pleased to congratulate Signora Rivolta on the
discovery, and to acknowledge her as a relative.
His lordship then smiling, said, “I feel myself
very happy in this discovery, inasmuch as it
relieves me of a burden, and saves me from the
use of those arguments and persuasions, which
I might otherwise have been compelled to use
to persuade you, madam, to suffer me to relinquish
in your favor that property which our
scrupulous friend refuses to accept. I am
satisfied that my late relative did not consider
his foreign marriage valid, or I am sure he
would have made a different disposal of his
property. I will not, however, carry my
scruples so far as to affect a relinquishment on
this ground of that which has been bequeathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to me. The questionable surplus is, however,
clearly yours.”</p>

<p>His lordship then took his leave of the party
and returned to Trimmerstone, where he
amused himself with rebuking the follies of
his own past life, and enjoying the high consideration
which his rank gave him among his
dependents and tenants. But he felt himself
dissatisfied with the world, and hardly knew
how to discriminate between the regret of past
pleasures and the remorse for past follies.</p>

<p>There now arose another difficulty; and
Markham had now to use to Signora Rivolta
the same arguments which he had previously
used to the Earl of Trimmerstone. Signora
Rivolta had said that Lord Trimmerstone
ought not to have accepted the surrender; with
what propriety could she, after that avowal,
accept it herself?</p>

<p>During the discussion which took place after
Lord Trimmerstone had departed, the mother
of Clara observed, by the frequent direction of
Markham’s looks, that his thoughts were still
on that subject what they had ever been. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
saw and knew that there was also a responsive
feeling on the part of her child, and it was in
her resolution to yield to that affection. Without
speaking decisively on the subject of the
property which now solicited her acceptance,
she desired that another meeting might take
place on the following day. This was hint
enough for Markham to take his leave. The
venerable priest departed at the same time.
He was mightily pleased with the liberal and
good feeling of the young heretic, and was not
without some hopes of converting him. They
walked together towards Markham’s chambers.</p>

<p>It was late, and Markham pressed the old gentleman
to dine with him. And their conversation
grew extremely animated after dinner, and
the priest was so communicative that he actually
told Markham of the intention of proposing, and
that immediately, to place Clara in a religious
house on the continent. The enamoured barrister
found that no time was to be lost; and
though it might not be altogether consonant to
his exquisitely refined notions of disinterestedness,
he resolved to take the earliest opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of offering his hand to Clara. There is a point
beyond which disinterestedness and generosity
are not expected to proceed. Markham saw that
he was now at that point; and as soon as his
guest had left him, he wrote a note to Signora
Rivolta, and another to Clara.</p>

<p>These notes were received early on the following
morning; and soon after them, and before
the arrival of Father Martini, the barrister was
at the house of Signora Rivolta, and whether it
was accidental or intentional, Clara was alone
in the drawing-room. Markham’s notes were on
the table. The young gentleman saw the notes,
and that they had been opened; and he knew by
the countenance of the young lady that they had
been read, and he thought that they had produced
the effect designed. We have made very
particular inquiries of both parties as to what was
said by each, but we could not persuade them to
tell us: in fact, they both protested that they
did not know. We are sorry for this, because it
would have made a beautiful scene, and have
filled a chapter in a style perfectly original.</p>

<p>From this moment the interest of the narrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
ceases; and we have only to say, that the
parents of Markham lived to see their son enjoy
the fruits of integrity and intellect; and that
Signora Rivolta was more leniently disposed
towards heretics than Father Martini thought
perfectly safe; and for fear he should witness
her apostacy, he returned to Italy. Colonel
Rivolta may be seen any day during the season
smoking a cigar in Pall Mall.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
